Dilemma Description,Person_1's answer,Person_2's answer,Person_3's answer,Person_4's answer
"I joined a lab during graduate school and was assigned to a post-doc, who immediately had me working
with him to synthesize a key compound for his project. We worked on the compound for a number of
months with him directing the effort. However, I was pleased with my own contributions and was
delighted to get positive feedback from him. Indeed, the overall experience I was having was very
positive, making me work even harder on the project.
That’s when things got interesting. Early one evening, when we felt we were very close to
success, I decided to stay a bit longer in the lab and try out some hunches. As I systematically tried out
each one and tested it to see if it was correct, I FINALLY GOT IT. I verified it over and over to make sure.
And I was overjoyed. I wrote it up, and left the lab in the wee hours of the morning elated but
exhausted.
So I didn’t get to the lab until late the next morning, but I wasn’t concerned because I knew my
senior partner would be gratified. What do I see, however, but him talking to the PI of the project and
taking credit for my discovery of the previous evening. I walked over and was astonished to hear him
saying to the PI, “I verified the compound this morning, so we’re on our way.” Apparently, he saw my
lab notes of the evening before, duplicated my test that morning, and now was taking credit for it as his
own!
When I got him in private, I was very upset and told him that the last, crucial step in the
experiment—the one I did the previous evening—was my idea and my work. He laughed in my face and
said that I was only tinkering around with some obvious strategies and that sooner or later one of us
would finalize it. In other words, he was entirely dismissing the importance of my work the night before
and arguing that the outcome was inevitable no matter which one of us did it. So, he was claiming the
work as largely his own because the project was his and he did most of the intellectual work.
How should a lab resolve this problem? In a situation like this, who should get credit and what
should the decisional process be?","I think you should talk to the PI about this problem and ask for an opportunity to get a three-people talk in person. After then, you should always keep a lab note, clearly indicating who has done which experiment, to avoid the misalignments in information again.","Credit for lab work is often ambiguous as it is oftentimes impossible to achieve a discovery without the help of an entire team. It is true that without his efforts your discovery would not have happened as his work no doubt played a role in your discovery. In that sense, the discovery should not be credited to only you alone, but rather to the entire team. That being said, it is obviously ridiculous that the senior partner decided to take credit for your discovery and even more preposterous when he laughed in your face. Consequently, you should immediately get your PI involved as, although credit for the discovery should go to the team, within the team, you should deserve the credit.","I think your contribution to the result cannot be ignored, because even though the project is this postdoc's, your contribution should be marked on this work of synthesizing the key compound. So for now, first of all, you should give your feedback to the PI to fight for your intellectual rights, and if the PI doesn't recognize your point of view either, then you should give your feedback to a higher leader in the lab and make it known to a wider audience to get support.","I should, because of the key procedures and results are my work. People who come up with an idea and people who do the work are all coontributors."
"Graduate students A and B are working on somewhat different but sometimes
overlapping aspects of the same project at the same university. Their labs are side-byside, and they share ideas often and compare data occasionally.
In one of their discussions and without realizing it, Student B suggests a novel
experimental idea to Student A. A is immediately struck by the idea’s value, but he does
not relate his insight back to B. Instead and in secret, Student A implements the idea
and begins a series of experiments and data collection. While this is happening and
some weeks later, Student B realizes the same idea. She quickly discusses it with
Student A, who, unbeknownst to B, is already well along in using it.
Student B is finishing up a group of experiments and cannot start anything new.
That allows Student A to finish his data collection and write up the results. Student A
presents a finished paper to his PI without any acknowledgement of Student B. Upon
reading the paper, Student B is enraged and claims that Student A committed plagiarism
by using a critical idea of hers without acknowledgment.
Please comment. ","I think student A contributed to most of the project, though the early stage idea is from student B. Student A shouldn't act as not knowing and add student B into the acknowledgment and thanks of the project paper. Meanwhile, the plagiarism claim from student B also doesn't stand because doing research is always a kind of racing: whoever gets the outcome first is the king. Student A and B should build up trust between each other again, or select to talk less about their possible personal project ideas.","In the scenario, it seems like in Student A and Student B’s original conversation, Student B suggested an idea that maybe was not fully formed or, at the very least, was unable to identify the value of the idea. As such, this scenario should be determined plagiarism depending on the degree of which Student A copied and the how much of an idea Student B actually gave. If Student A was simply inspired by Student B’s set of words, it would be hard to justify plagiarism. However, if Student B feels as if Student A basically took her idea, Student B should start to collect evidence and open a case to her school board. On a side note, it is imperative that Student A should not have kept Student B in the dark.","I think it is difficult to judge whether the situation is academic plagiarism from the information we already have, because in that description, Student B told Student A about a relatively novel experimental idea, but it is difficult to judge what percent of Student A's final output was Student A's own contribution. However, although it is difficult to determine whether the situation is academic plagiarism, in principle, Student A should not have started the project in secret without telling Student B, and should have mentioned Student B in the acknowledgements of his paper.","The behaviour of student A is improper. Student A should first tell student B and get her approval. Also, this must be mentioned in the acknowledgement."
"David is a new postdoc in Dr. Goliath’s lab. Upon David’s arrival to the lab, Dr. Goliath assigned
him a few experiments to firm up some results of a paper that had been rejected by a journal.
These experiments had not been performed because the technician who was working on the
project and was the rejected paper’s first author had since left the lab. David was given a copy
of the (rejected) manuscript to review and to assess what needed to be done for a second
submission. After reading the paper, David felt that the quality of the writing was poor and
that, along with including the results from the control experiments Dr. Goliath asked him to do,
the manuscript needed to be completely re-written.
David expressed all this to Dr. Goliath, who agreed that David should take ownership of
the paper and improve it. Upon completing and adding the results of the control experiments
and then re-writing the original manuscript entirely, David re-submitted the paper without
consulting the original author who had performed the bulk of the work of the original
manuscript. The reviewers gave enthusiastic reviews of the re-submission and the paper was
accepted with minor revisions
Was it appropriate that David replaced the original author as first author? Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab? Should the technician
have been informed about the changes to the manuscript prior to the new submission? Should
the technician have been invited to comment on or contribute to the new submission?","I think it's appropriate for David to list him as the first author. And it's also appropriate for David to rewrite all the manuscripts without informing the original technician, because the technician had chosen to leave the group abandoning his original work. But I think the PI still need to inform the original author(the technician) about the changes made to the paper and the author placement.","Since it sounds like the technician sort of “threw away” the paper, I believe it is fine for David to replace the original manuscript with a reformed one. The moment the technician left the lab, it was his responsibility to keep in touch with David and contact and aid him with respect to the paper. Unless the technically specifically request to be contacted, he should not be surprised that his rejected paper was revamped and upgraded. In addition, it seems as though David changed a significant portion of the pape, as such, it is not ridiculous to label himself as the main author. That being said, credit should still be given to the technician no doubt.","Since David almost rewrote the manuscript, it is reasonable for him to replace the original author as the first author. Since the technician had left the laboratory before rewriting the manuscript, I think David has no obligation to inform the technician of the revision of the manuscript and does not need to obtain his permission in advance. But I think the name of the technician should be mentioned in the acknowledgments/contributions to show recognition and respect for his previous work.",I think David's behaviour should be known by that technician and be agreed. It's improper for David to directly be the first author and change everything without the technician's approval.
"A PI moves his lab to a different university, but a few of his postdocs and students stay back.
Once settled in, the PI decides to rewrite manuscripts already in preparation, changing the
authorship order to favor those who joined him. He also reserves the right to prohibit
publication of any research conducted in his old lab, on the presumptive authority of his role as
PI.
Is this ethical? Please comment.","I think it's appropriate for the PI to stop his research in the old school after he moved to a new school, but the previous projects should at least get the original author/students informed of the changes in authors and projects, while trying to complete online research with the students still want to participate in.","This is not ethical at all. Authorship of a paper should not change based on his switch to his university. The moment he switched, he should no longer have the presumptive authority as a PI in his old lab and should therefore not have a say in any research conducted there. Furthermore, editing manuscripts that came from the old lab should come with notifications to the older team. ","I don't think this is ethical. First of all, the PI can decide to rewrite a manuscript that has already been prepared, but he should not adjust the order of authors based on whether the author is a new member. In addition, I also think that the PI does not have absolute authority over previous work.",It's improper. Everything should be fair. He should not be too harsh on members of his old lab who do not join him after that.
"George Washington is one of two postdocs working in Dr. Big’s lab. The other postdoc, Dee
Nye, is older and has more years of experience than George, but although she is approaching
the end of her postdoc term, she has no first-author publications nor has she received any
extramural grants. Because Dee will need to leave the lab soon and find a position elsewhere,
there is a keen desire on her and on Dr. Big’s parts to make her marketable. Compounding her
overall lack of productivity is the fact that Dee does not get along very well with her coworkers; her presentations are poorly delivered; and her experimental designs are frequently
flawed.
Dr. Big likes George and tells him that he (i.e., Dr. Big) has taken it upon himself to write
a manuscript with Dee as primary author and that he will create all the necessary figures, albeit
using Dee’s data. He also tells George that he has written a rather complimentary letter for
Dee and embellished her qualifications in order to improve her job prospects.
George thinks that it is exceedingly unfair that Dee can be so unproductive and
unprofessional in the lab, yet emerge from this with someone else writing her manuscripts and
providing a glowing letter of recommendation. When he confesses this to Dr. Big, Dr. Big
answers, “I know, I know. But someday you’ll have to manage a situation like this, and you’ll
just want to be rid of this person. Besides, if I want to make her the first author on a paper, I
have that authority, don’t I?”
George is not convinced by Dr. Big’s argument, but he isn’t going to quarrel with Dr. Big
and he certainly won’t miss Dee Nye. Nevertheless, Dr. Big’s behaviors seem ethically
problematic. Please comment.","Although every advisor like Dr. Big will expect his postdocs to have a nice job in the future, he is not responsible for his students and doing this would harm Dee when she find herself incapable of the work she has been assigned at work. George should follow his own will of doing this for Dr. Big, but it's wrong for Dr. Big to do all those things for Dee.","To glorify a person during any application or instance where you have to market yourself in almost common practice today. We must, however, draw a hard line between glorification and fabrication, the former being relatively expected while the latter is within the realms of unethical. In this scenario, I believe George should evaluate if her qualities were “embellished” or misleading to the point where it’s basically deception. Of course, the company that would want to hire her will need to do the due diligence to analyze whether her application is fitting or not.","There is no doubt that Dr. Bigs' behavior was unethical, including but not limited to designating the first author of the paper instead of the contribution to the paper according to his own will and falsifying/exaggerating the content of the recommendation letter. For George, it is obviously not a decent thing to remain silent, and it also damages his academic reputation as a member of the laboratory.",Dr. Big should not behave like that. He should be fair and honest to Dee Nye. Who is the first author and issues like recommendation letters should be completely true and honest.
"Some years ago, I worked as a bronchoscopy technician on a lung transplant service.
This service maintained a very aggressive post transplant surveillance regimen that was
formally connected with the hospital's translational research efforts.
After lung transplantation, patients were seen 9 or 10 times over the course of
the first year. They routinely had bronchoscopy, which included a saline flush whereby
tissue from the lobe could be collected and then analyzed for signs of infection or
rejection. Additionally, patients underwent transbronchial biopsies with the tissue sent
to pathology for evaluation of developing allograft rejection. The tissue was also sent to
the research labs for collaborative translational studies. Patients also went through a
series of breathing tests, thoracic CT scans, and blood draws during their regular check
ups.
This aggressive follow-up was not without controversy. Many, probably most, in
the field believed it was necessary to detect rejection or infection early so as to
intervene rapidly and as effectively as possible. Others felt that these patients should
be left alone after transplant unless symptoms actually arose. I recall one transplant
group in particular claiming that their center's overall post transplant survival times are
just as good as those at centers that use the more aggressive regimen.
I believed that it was an honest question as to whether the aggressive
management at my facility was, in fact, providing better patient care. The central
problem was that lung graft survival times are less than desired overall and have not
changed much over the past decade. More research is needed to better understand
and be able to predict and treat episodes of lung allograft rejection before total graft
failure occurs and the patient dies. So, it is certainly fair to say that while aggressive
management for both clinical and research purposes might have problematically put the
patient at an increased risk without immediate personal benefit, transplant knowledge
gained through the diligent and extensive collection of clinical and biological data is the
only way to better understand the pathology of lung allograft rejection and why some
treatments do or don't work. Of course, the most likely beneficiaries of this knowledge
will be future patients, not the ones we are currently treating.                                                                                                      The second ethical problem with this research was the collection of lung alveolar
tissue by transbronchial biopsy for both clinical and research purposes. This is a
procedure that poses serious risks with even the possibility of death. However, the
procedure is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of lung allograft rejection. The
problem is that while we wanted to take biopsies for both clinical as well as research
purposes, sometimes the decision had to be made to skip one or the other because of
an occasionally limited ability to obtain tissue.
Multiple biopsies are the gold standard because rejection can be occurring in a
portion of the lung not sampled, thus leading to false negatives. But when the tissue
samples at a particular visit only go to research and the patient eventually goes into
rejection, I have wondered whether we would have caught some of the false negatives
sooner had the samples only gone to the clinical lab.                                                                                                            Perhaps there is no ethical solution to these issues because lung transplantation
is hardly a perfect science. But there certainly seems to be ample room for ethical
reflection on the somewhat conflicting stakes between research and patient care, and
the clinical uncertainties that are part and parcel of lung transplantation. ","There definitely need to have patients who contribute to the mass public to let doctors/researchers to do the lung research to increase the chance of survivals on future surgeries, at the risk of his own live. But doing this type of things still need to have the patients agreement and not to do it secretly without the permission of the patient or patient's family.","In the first dilemma, it seems highly debatable on what method saves the most lives. As such, it seems the root of the problem is the lack of research or understanding within the subject matter; it seems both the aggressive follow-up and the alternative have their pros and cons. As for the second dilemma, the original poster is exactly correct on the medical field being “hardly a perfect science.” As such, when it comes to dangerous data collection, two questions must be asked: how potential risks and what are the benefits? Which side simply outweighs the other?","I think the key point in both of the above ethical issues is whether the patient is informed. I don't think transplant personnel can choose the ""more ethical"" option for the patient in these two issues. Instead, what transplant personnel can do is to inform the patient of all the pros and cons, risks, and various possible situations of their plan.",It reflects the conflicts between patients and long-term scientific progress. I think it's necessary to prior patients' health.
"Jane is a very motivated and bright graduate student who is trying hard to purify a protein in a
highly specialized area of research. Despite her perseverance, she meets with failure after
failure. Finally, she goes to her PI, Dr. Smith, who is an internationally recognized investigator in
Jane’s area of research, and confesses her problem. The PI is silent for a while and then says,
“Don’t fret. I’ll have something for you to look at tomorrow.” The following day when Jane
arrives at the lab, she sees an unpublished manuscript on her desk with a post-it note from Dr.
Smith that says: “Jane, read the methods and results sections of this paper. I think they might
contain the solution to your problems. But don’t tell anybody I gave you this. As soon as you
are finished, return the paper to me. And don’t make any copies of it.” The paper describes an
experiment that seems exactly suited to solving Jane’s problem. Sure enough and within a few
days, Jane has purified the protein using the approach. She gleefully reports all this to her PI
and returns the paper. She can’t help asking though, “Dr. Smith, I have searched the literature
high and low to find a method to help me with my project and found absolutely nothing. Where
did you get that manuscript?” to which Dr. Smith obliquely replies, “Oh, I’ve got a ton of them.”
Discuss the ethical dimensions of this scenario.","We have to discuss the problem clear: if Dr. Smith is sharing a in group or in university research from his friend professors or other lab members, Dr. Smith should still ask for his student's permission to share the experiment results. If Dr Smith is actually reviewing for a conference or journal and sent others research work to his lab member, that should be banned and it's really bad.","It’s hard to know the ethical implications without any further knowledge of Dr. Smith’s mysterious manuscript and what he really means by “I’ve got a ton of them.” Naturally, if this means that he has many unsubmitted/scrapped papers that he is just holding onto, it is his right to give his work and manuscripts away to Jane as it is his intellectual property. On the flip side, if this was not his paper, say one of his students wrote it, this is where it becomes highly unethical. Without explicit notification to the original author of the paper, Dr. Smith should not share any of the information to an outside source.","I think Dr. Smith's behavior is undoubtedly against academic ethics. We may speculate that the rationale for the manuscript she gave to Jane came from Dr. Smith's own manuscript, but if this speculation is true, then she would not ask Jane not to tell anyone about the existence of the manuscript and not to copy it. The only reasonable explanation is that Dr. Smith is a reviewer of a journal, and the manuscript is an academic article that the contributor surrenders to the journal. In this case, Dr. Smith's behavior is very unethical.",Dr. Smith must tell the author before doing so.
"I once worked in a lab that conducted anti-aging research. The lab was operated by Dr. Smith,
who also owned and operated an assisted living facility nearby.
Dr. Smith was intrigued by homeopathic remedies that he thought might slow the aging
process and improve quality of life. His research centered on vitamin and nutritional
supplements, topical creams and salves, exercise programs and so on. Laboratory personnel
were constantly going to the assisted living facility and drawing blood, taking skin samples,
measuring bone density and respiratory capacity and the like.
I began feeling uncomfortable when I noticed that some of our research participants,
who had early senility or dementia and had little idea of what was going on, had their consent
to research participation signed by Dr. Smith. When I asked him about this, he looked a bit
anxious but told me that these individuals had signed over their power-of-attorney to him upon
entering the facility, and that he was therefore allowed to make decisions for them, including
research participation.
When we were informed that we were going to be visited by some representatives of a
grant foundation that might fund our work, Dr. Smith explicitly told us to say that we knew
nothing about how our various biological specimens were procured. He also told us to say that
our current research was on the cusp of success even though none of our assays had indicated
anything unique or exciting. He also made a point to remind all of us of the confidentiality and
nondisclosure stipulations in our employment contracts, which sounded like a veiled threat
should any of us discuss some of Smith’s problematic practices with the funding team or any
other outsiders.
We did not get the grant, and after a few months, I simply couldn’t tolerate the situation
any longer, and I left. Please comment.",Dr Smith is too keen on finding research results that match his schedule and direction so that he deliberately force the patients and his lab members to do experiments outside the scope of what has been told to the test patients. This is strongly unethical way of treating things. Research and papers are not the only thing. It is right to leave the lab. You should also work with your friends to unveil the nasty behavior of Dr Smith.,"It seems plainly obvious that Dr. Smith was well aware of his unethical practices. There are plenty of laws regulating consent for medical tests in which making a decision for someone because they entered a facility is definitely not one of them. When it comes to the grant, again, Dr. Smith is very well aware of his shadiness. He is no doubt offering a misleading narrative and even arguably threatening his employees. Although it is true that patient confidentiality remains an utmost concern, it seems like he didn’t even get formal consent.","Dr. Smith's behavior is undoubtedly unethical. Patients should be informed of all information and risks before participating in any medical procedures and whether to participate in medical research, but Dr. Smith made the decision for them. In addition, Dr. Smith even threatened his team not to disclose the incident.","Dr. Smith has the power-of-attorney, but should make decisions based on what's good for them, instead of his own research. The research must be done in a fair and honest way."
"I had decided to submit my first abstract ever for a neuroscience conference that I very much
wanted to attend. My research consisted of running human subjects through an fMRI scan so
as to collect brain activation data in response to simple visual stimuli. My data and analyses
appeared solid as the time drew near for me to write the abstract, so I was excited and eager to
proceed. My postdoc slowed me down, however, with a suggestion that I include a few more
subjects in the study. I agreed but voiced a concern that the submission deadline was coming
up. “Maybe you can use yourself in your study,” he said. “I mean, it’s only an abstract that
you’re submitting, and you can recruit more subjects between now and the conference and
make corrections accordingly.”
I was uneasy about using myself as a subject. I felt it was somehow unethical even
though I knew there was no way I could bias the results of the study due to the simplicity of the
paradigm I was using. Luckily, I was spared the problem: The next day my postdoc recruited
some subjects for the study so I avoided having to use myself. However, I still wonder what
would have happened if new subjects were not recruited. It was such a simple experiment that
I couldn’t have affected the results. But would recruiting myself be considered a conflict of
interest or be somehow unethical? ","I think it's OK as long as you, as the subject, was strictly following the setup and the experiment of your planning and don't secretly edit the result. But only one person isn't enough, you still need to find more subjects for your experiment.","When recruiting yourself for your own study, ethical concerns only arise if the situation actually creates a conflict of interest. In other words, if you yourself are expecting an outcome or contain bias about your own experiment, using yourself will lead to not just biased results, but also ethical concerns. Consequently, whether recruiting yourself is unethical or not is heavily dependent on the specific scenario. In the original poster's case, it seems perfectly clear that using himself would not arise any problems, as long as it was mentioned in the abstract. Of course, reproducibility is a large part of experiments, so it is expected that he can reproduce himself with those later subjects.","I think recruiting yourself for an experiment is not unethical in itself, but what is really unethical is recruiting yourself in order to make your own experiment present the desired results and influence the content of the experiment. But no matter what, recruiting yourself can only provide a subject for your own research, which is far from enough in most cases.",One can only participate in his own experiment only if knowing the contents in advance does not influence the outcomes.
"One of the oddest but most memorable experiences I ever had in my graduate and postgraduate training occurred one morning when I got to the lab rather early. Our lab was
a large one, and had recruited a number of fine, junior investigators from Southeast
Asia. As I hung up my coat, I glanced into an adjacent room and saw three of them
apparently praying over their experimental materials. They were standing around their
lab table. Their eyes were tightly shut, and they were obviously chanting a prayer, all
the while making circular arm movements with their palms outstretched over the
experiment. I quickly moved away, and I don’t think they saw me.
This may sound crazy but is that ethical? I mean, can you ethically argue that
researchers should not pray over their experiments because such activity might
heighten their interpretational biases or—and this is where things really get vague—
introduce some kind of “contaminating variable” into the experiment? I mean, there
have been research studies on the power of prayer in medicine with some studies
actually showing positive results.
I’ll never forget this provocative and rather touching experience. It posed such a
contrast, or maybe I should say a confluence, between deeply felt and applied
spirituality with the objective, scientific mindset of Western research. But should the
lab director condone this sort of thing as a regular practice? Do you think it poses any
cause for ethical or professional concern?","I think it's more down to a religious behavior and hope in their heart of the experiment going on as they planned. Normally it won't affect the results of the experiment, and I think it's okay for them to do so. This is still ethical.","Whether spirituality in the lab is ethical seems rather context dependent more so than black and white answers. The prayer and religion itself do not raise any ethical concerns, but, in the event where it affects the outcomes of the study, due to being overly hopeful, for example, it can raise some ethical concerns. Furthermore, if it’s praying for exactly one outcome from the experiment, this could cause a plethora of different biases that will affect the study. Of course, you could really argue this about anything, as such, the prayer itself should be deemed ethical as long as the outcome isn’t skewed.","I think the key to this matter is not to pray for the experimental results themselves. If, as described in the text, these researchers did not directly affect the experimental results, then this matter would not be so ethical. But in fact, I think this kind of prayer behavior is a reflection of the inner expectations of the experimental results. If the researchers intervene in the experimental data to a certain extent because of their obsession, then this is undoubtedly unethical, but this matter is actually irrelevant to the prayer itself.","I think praying in this way doesn't really influence the outcome, it's just hoping for the expected outcome. It's their right to do so."
"I was finishing my senior year in college—a small mid-Western, liberal arts college—and was working in
Dr. Smith’s lab. Now, this college did not receive many grants, but Dr. Smith was recognized throughout
the school (and frankly envied by a lot of his colleagues) as a real rainmaker. Despite the rather humble
resources of the college, Smith was always getting money to run and grow his lab, and he turned out a
number of students over the years who went on to have significant careers in science.
I was doing some extra-credit work in his lab, frankly hoping to be able to add material to my
resume as I was applying to veterinary school. I was finishing a preliminary project and had gotten some
very preliminary, but very interesting data. With graduation looming, however, I was discouraged that I
couldn’t replicate them. Naturally, I reported this to Dr. Smith, and we worked on it some. But to no
avail: we simply could not replicate the original findings.
I then had to write a final report on this project which we would send to the funding agency for
grant continuation. I duly noted the nature of the experiments, the preliminary data, and the fact that
repeated attempts to replicate the data failed. I turned the report into Dr. Smith, but when he gave me
the final copy that he was sending to the funding agency, I noticed that he had deleted the sentences
about the data replication failures.
I asked him why, and he said that it was abundantly clear in the report that this data was very
preliminary and was not at all being described as definitive. Second, he remarked that my project was
one of three others that he was reporting on, and that these projects were much farther along and more
important to the grantor. He felt that my findings were relatively insignificant in comparison to the
others so there wasn’t any point in belaboring my current failure to replicate my results. Third, he
pointed out that it might still be possible to replicate the data. He speculated that perhaps my samples
had gotten contaminated and that if we had a few more months to work on it, we’d confirm my original
results.
And that was it. I graduated and moved on. But Dr. Smith’s omitting mention of my replication
failures has always stuck in my memory. Was it wrong or was he justified? ","From Dr. Smith's perspective, it's important to report nice results to someone above in order to gain fame and reputation, on the basis of you being a not that experienced senior student, there may still be a way to replicate the results of the previous study. From your perspective, you think Dr. Smith is cheating and reporting the fake stuff, but he also balanced his situation for the final decision.","To glorify a person during any application or instance where you have to market yourself in almost common practice today. We must, however, draw a hard line between glorification and fabrication, the former being relatively expected while the latter is within the realms of unethical. In the scenario, omitting the truth could be considered lying and a misrepresentation of the current experiment; however, it is hard to know without any further context. Consequently, the information about the failed trials should not be omitted. If, for example, there is evidence that the samples actually were contaminated and that this wasn’t wishful thinking, the failures should not only be mentioned but an idea of how to resolve them should be stated as well.","From a factual perspective, it is indeed unethical for Dr. Smith to conceal the fact that he failed to repeat the experiment, because the sponsor has the right to know the full true results of his experiment. But from a certain perspective, what Dr. Smith said is not completely unreasonable, because after all, this experiment once obtained those interesting data, and the current inability to reproduce may be due to negligence in a certain step during the experiment. However, as long as Dr. Smith and the person describing the problem still try to reproduce the experimental data later, Dr. Smith's remarks cannot be said to be completely deceptive.","It's not good, but it's not cheating, because everything mentioned is true."
"My PI and I were working on an experiment to see if Y occurred when a particular gene was
knocked out. If Y did indeed occur, we would be keen to publish the finding. Determining
whether or not Y occurred would require our doing some assays.
The problem was that assay #1 confirmed Y, but assay #2 disconfirmed Y. It must be
noted that these were not duplicate assays but completely different ones. And repeated assays
of both types kept giving us the same contradictory findings.
So, the first issue was the temptation to simply tell my PI of the preferred result, namely
the one that confirmed Y. I told myself this wouldn’t be a lie, but it came close. So, I told the PI
about both assays. At this point we were confronted with the following decisions: Should we
publish (and therefore believe) the results from the assay that worked and disregard the “bad”
one, assuming that the problem involved some flaw in that assay? Or should we mention in the
publication that we were only able to show Y with one assay, and not with another? Or should
we try a third assay and go with it (as a tie-breaker)?
We went with the last strategy which fortunately confirmed Y and justified our paper.
But suppose there wasn’t a third assay available? What then? ","If there's no third assay, this may still requires extra work to do with the Y thing, if you really desired it to be valid so that you can make significant impact to the related researches. But if you choose to neglect the second assay, your work will not withstand the test of time and will be corrected by others, and it will also affect your own future studies because you are working based on a unproven hypothesis. So you shouldn't publish the research neglecting the second assay if there's no third assay.","The original poster is correct in that when the question remains up in the air, more information is needed. However, they ask an interesting question on what if more information is unobtainable through a third assay. For starters, both assays should be mentioned in the paper even if you heavily believe in favor of the first one; selectively picking which data to go with in the publishcation is strongly unethical. As such, I suggest drilling down and theorizing the reasoning behind the different results. If there is sufficient evidence that the 2nd assay failed for a particular reason, in the paper, you should mention that and strongly highlight the idea. In other words, you should wait until you have more information to make an informed decision on what you believe in and what you publish whether that was with a 3rd assay or not.","If there is no third test available, I think you need to report the true results of the first two tests in the report. If you are more inclined to one of the first two test results, you can also explain this point of view in the report and argue your reasons. In addition, you can also explain why you think the other experimental result may not be ideal. But in any case, it is important to report all your experimental results truthfully. As for the right or wrong of its argument, these can allow readers or subsequent researchers to further ponder or experiment.","If a third method doesn't exist, we should report the contradiction and explore another way. Otherwise try to seek for special cases in the existing methods."
"By the time a researcher is a post-Doc, the odds are pretty good that he or she has probably heard if not
actually experienced an instance of an individual leaving a lab and taking his or her lab notebook along.
For obvious reasons, this frequently causes a great deal of emotional upset in the lab—not because the
research itself is of earth shattering importance but because the act raises the question of who really
owns the data and who has the right to control its dissemination.
The standard answer in academic research is that the University owns the data and the research
findings, but it is hard to convince an investigator of that when he or she is the one whose ideas
generated and whose work produced that data. So, what usually happens is that months of back and
forth communications go on, with the PI or the lab director trying to persuade the individual to return
his or her lab notebook, even though the University will often allow the individual to make and keep a
photocopy.
This kind of case always raises the following questions: Does the investigator have any right to
the ideas he or she developed while working at the lab? What considerations should this person make if
he tries to publish that data? How should such a situation be managed?","This kind of thing always requires the leaving investigator to talk with the professor or PI. The PI may has been the source of some ideas, but it's the investigator that does all the things. If it cannot be peacefully determined. The university has the right to keep the research work that is under its supervision.","Whether the person has the rights to publish the idea that came out of the lab for themselves is heavily dependent on the lab and is often signed into contract before they even start working in the lab. In most labs, the research is owned by the university as they provide the materials and infrastructure, and, therefore, if one were to leave the lab, they should request permission from the lab to publish it themselves. That being said, if the person can oftentimes come to an agreement with the PI or the university and go from there.","I think researchers have the right to keep the ideas they have while working in the lab. But when it comes to data and publication, I think it is a more complicated situation and should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. But it is important for researchers to maintain good communication with their previous labs and respect the lab's ideas and outputs while respecting their own research data.","Contributions should be considered. If it's hard to divide, they should communicate. One shouldn't take things away if those are not all his contributions."
"A number of fairly recent articles appearing in Nature and other journals over the last few years have
worried about the possibility of investigators’ manipulating images for publication. For example, in a
2006 on-line issue of Nature (at www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature04996.html) Dale
Benos noted that:
[D]igital image-processing programs make it a simple matter to prettify ugly gels. Unwanted
background, smudges and ‘non-specific’ bands can be easily removed from the final figure. I
have always thought that showing only a single band of interest in a figure such as a western
blot or immunoprecipitation experiment is a somewhat equivocal practice, although I admit I
have done it…If images are manipulated to enhance what we aim to demonstrate, even if our
intentions are good, we chip away at the integrity of the scientific enterprise and erase the trust
that the public places in our work.
So, are there any rules of thumb that investigators might use to distinguish allowable from unallowable
uses of image manipulaton? Or should only raw images be submitted to journal editors?","I think this is more down to everybody's conscience to maintain the integrity of the test result pictures to be correct and can be replicated. Photoshopping does help the investigators to show the main results more clearly if they are hard to spot, but there has been cases of faking images to get nice results for acceptance in journals or conferences. One should always provide their modifications in words to the original picture, otherwise it's unethical.","How much images get manipulated and how misleading the edited image will naturally affect the credibility of the journal. Modifying a picture is ethically grey; however, this happens so often within the internet today that it really isn’t deemed as a horrible act or even unethical at this point. Journals risk their credibility by releasing synthetic stories as opposed to their ethics.","I think the key to this issue is not whether researchers should be able to identify over-processed research images, which is only a passive prevention. What is really important is to take the initiative to prevent researchers who publish research content from having the motivation to tamper with experimental results by beautifying images. If beautifying experimental images is just to make the conclusions that are already reflected in the images more obvious, then I don’t think it is unethical; but if beautifying experimental images misleads readers, it is undoubtedly a tampering of experimental results. Of course, only allowing original images to be submitted to journals is an effective way to prevent the above phenomenon.","If it is just to standardize brightness, etc., and does not affect authenticity, then it should be allowed. If it is a forgery, etc., then it must be prohibited."
"Labs A & B had been collaborating for some time, leading to a publication that appeared
in a very prestigious journal. Some months later, Mary, who is a researcher from Lab A,
visited Lab B to learn a technique used in the paper. While there, she became highly
suspicious of the technique that the lab technicians and researchers were using. When
she questioned them, they were very vague in their explanations and never really
showed her how to do the experiment that she visited to learn. When she returned and
reported all this to her PI, he decided to do an experiment on his own. Instead of
sending the next batch of dissolved protein to Lab B as it was expecting, Mary's PI sent
pure water. Lab B generated data from the water. Mary's PI then called the PI of Lab B,
who denied wrongdoing and broke off the collaboration. Mary's PI did not publicly
report the false data, however, for fear that the earlier paper the labs had co-authored
might be suspected of data manipulation.
The PI from Lab B was clearly in an ethical bind. On the one hand, it certainly
appeared he had an obligation to report falsified data. On the other, he has an
obligation to protect his lab's future. The retraction of a previously published paper in a
very high impact journal would put his career and the future of his and his collaborator's
labs in jeopardy. Indeed, the consequences of a blemish to one PI's ethical conduct
would affect everyone else in the labs as they attempt to procure future funding and
jobs.
My PI appeared to feel more obligated to protect his lab's interests since he was
not involved in any fabrication, and had no proof of wrongdoing related to the
published paper. Still, these kinds of instances are probably not all that uncommon,
leading one to wonder how much data fabrication and fraud exist in scientific literature.",The lab B is unethical about their experiment results. Faking the experiment results is a very unethical behaviour. Lab B should cease the related research around the fake experiment and the fake results.,"From an ethical standpoint, falsifying data is obviously unethical. Putting aside the future of the labs or the careers of the people, if all we care about is ethics, Lab B should have never falsified data nor should Lab A allow them to get away with it. Lab A should try to recreate the experiment and replace Lab B’s finding entirely. Of course, in the real world, people must balance their ethical views with their obligations. It is understandable why both labs did what they did, but, as mentioned before, ethical speaking, they are both in the wrong.","First of all, I think both approaches have their own considerations, but the problem is that even if they do not make these fraudulent data public, if they have previously published articles in very well-known journals using these data, then data fraud is easy to be discovered. And when data fraud is discovered in this case instead of Lab A taking the initiative to report, it will have a huge negative impact on the academic reputation of Lab A. On the contrary, if Lab A now takes the initiative to report, and was previously unaware of the data fraud in its partner lab, then Lab A actually has no academic integrity issues.","In cooperation, one is also responsible for the behavior of the partner."
"I recall an uncomfortable period in a lab where I worked a few years ago. The lab was
productive, and the personnel worked reasonably well together. We had a number of very
intelligent and hard-working investigators who were trained in foreign countries—some of
them with MDs—but their English writing skills were poor. Nevertheless, these individuals
conceived the experimental designs of their projects and collected and interpreted the data.
Somehow, though, they managed to get the project’s PI to write their papers entirely, but with
them as first, second, etc., authors and with the PI as last.
The PI was comfortable with this arrangement. The problem arose when a postdoc was
asked to write these investigators’ papers. She didn’t like the arrangement one bit. As far as
she was concerned, she hadn’t participated in the investigators’ research and so shouldn’t be
writing their papers. And even if she had participated to some extent, she felt that writing their
papers entirely by herself was unreasonably time-consuming. Furthermore, she argued that if
she would write such a paper entirely by herself, then she deserved first authorship, regardless
of the amount of work she devoted to the project itself.
A sort of truce was reached when the postdoc let everyone know that if she became
more involved in the investigators’ research from the beginning, she would be willing to do the
writing if they did most of the data gathering. She still objected, though, to the investigators
being listed as first authors without their writing or editing anything. But she compromised on
a number of occasions to maintain peace and productivity.
Sometime later, both she and I left the lab. I’ve often wondered whether this situation
continued. Please comment. ","Paper writing has always been one part of the whole research, and the projects should let the investigators to do the writing. If the investigators are not doing reading, at least let someone that is good at english writing to be at least the leading author of the research.","A large part of doing research is writing and interpreting the results yourself. Consequently, the investigators should have written the papers themselves with the aid from someone else, rather than that someone else writing their entire paper for them. It does not make sense to be the first author on a paper if none of the words written on the paper is from that author even if they were a large part of the experiments. ","I think the postdoc's claim is reasonable. The paper is the main means of outputting arguments for the entire research, and its author should be the person who participates in most of the experimental design, data collection and interpretation. Because only in this way can one have a sufficient understanding of the experiment and output reasonable and accurate arguments.",It is understandable that such an arrangement would not be accepted. Effective communication is the best way to resolve these issues.
"This dilemma occurred some years ago when I was in high school. I was taking a biology course
from a teacher I greatly respected. He was passionate about his subject; he took pains to teach
it well; and I was doing well in the class.
Toward the end of the year, however, I became distressed over an upcoming project
that would involve a dissection. While I will not argue about the pros and cons of animal
experimentation, I felt then (and still do) that gathering up thousands of frogs, cats, fetal pigs,
etc. for high school students (many of whom will go to college and study history or interior
design) is simply a gross waste of life. At the very least, I believe that an honest conscientious
objection such as mine constituted a reasonable justification for the teacher's assigning a
substitute activity for the dissection project.
To say he disagreed with me would be putting it mildly. He was insistent that dissection
was a mandatory part of the class and that if I refused to participate, my current grade of A
would become a C. He also informed me that he was under no obligation from the school to
accommodate me or my objections, claiming that ""morals have no place in my classroom.""
Fortunately, the school administrators were more understanding, once my irate mother
called. They insisted that my teacher would have to prepare an alternative assignment for me
or any other student who did not wish to participate in the dissection. He went along, but only
after telling me he was doing so against his will. I also remember a remarkable threat: that if
he so much as caught me or any other dissenter wearing a leather belt, he would fail us.
Ultimately, two other students and I completed the alternative assignment—which was
more than twice the workload of the dissection project—and I kept my A for the course. But
my relationship with the teacher was never the same. I could no longer respect him as I once
had. I felt he had ignored my values and my rights and had only yielded from force and with
bitterness.
On the other hand, a dilemma like mine raises the larger question about the limits of
conscientious objection among science students. Suppose a student refuses to do an
assignment because he (or his parents) objects to certain anatomical drawings in his textbook,
or that he does not wish to participate in classes on reproduction, or learning about the
construction of the atomic bomb? How might one discriminate between ethically reasonable
versus unreasonable objections to certain material in science curricula?","I think it's fair for a teacher to encourage students to do the animal related things in a biology class, maybe it helps students to understand biology more and perform better in future biology learning in college. But the teacher's behaviour of forcing other students reluctant to do so is really bad and unethical. One teacher should never force the students to do this kind of things.","There are many cases similar to this one from a law standpoint rather than an ethical one. In law, each of these scenarios are dealt on a case by case basis, where it heavily depends on the situation for whether it's an unreasonable objection or not. If it impedes on ones freedom of religion, for instance, it could be ruled as unlawful. From an ethical standpoint, it again is case by case, but there is an extra layer of complication. For example, when it comes to a school course, the factor to consider is the expectation. If you are taking high school biology there is no expectation (at least not anymore) where you would have to dissect a frog; however, if you were to take a dissecting class in college, it would be nonsensical to make a conscientious objection about dissecting. Once the expectation is set, it is really up to the school whether they are able to accommodate the student or not.","I think both sides are wrong in this matter. First of all, from the students' perspective, dissection is indeed an irreplaceable project for some biology courses, and it is difficult to replace it with other homework projects. If students cannot accept dissection, then it is the students' responsibility to find out whether there is dissection homework before choosing this course. But from the teacher's perspective, his words were too intense, especially when he said ""morals have no place in my classroom."" This is undoubtedly a kind of disrespect for students.",I find it acceptable to refuse to do such experiments because of my own values. Teachers should respect the values and beliefs of their students.
"Some years ago, while I was still an undergraduate, I worked in a lab that did research
on topics pertaining to cardiothoracic surgery. Most of the projects in the lab used
animal subjects.
Our project required us to put mice to sleep by injecting chemicals, and then
cannulating their hearts while the hearts were still beating. This was quite difficult
because their aortas are very tiny and it was hard to insert the cannula without
puncturing the vessel. Initially, the plan was to perfect the cannulation procedure on
normal mice, and then perform the procedure on genetically mutant mice that would be
provided to us by collaborators.
In retrospect, neither the other student nor myself had the experience to be able
to perform this intricate surgical procedure. We ended up sacrificing many mice,
without ever being able to establish a working model. I believe we sacrificed these mice
needlessly due to our inexperience and, in fact, the inexperience of our research team.
Ironically, a week after we stopped doing the procedure, a surgical fellow visiting from a
foreign country took over the project and after sacrificing only a few mice was able to
develop a working model within a week.
It might be expected that researchers become desensitized given the frequency
with which animals are sacrificed for experiments, but I continue to feel poorly about
the unnecessary sacrifice and suffering of animals.
What kinds of ethical recommendations might this situation invite in order to
diminish harm to laboratory animals?","It's normal for beginners to struggle to inject chemicals to mice. Though it's sad to see so much mice sacrifising, it's still necessary to do so in order to be ethical to mice. The pros may have been experienced at doing this and finished the same with fewer loss to mice, but surely they also have one time when they also need to kill a lot of mice to get the injection working. And it's also not realistic for the students to always ask the surgical fellow to do the injection for them all the time.","The problem is not that mice are being used as test subjects, but the inexperience and lack of guidance from professionals that caused the unnecessary deaths. It it clear that they had this information and guidance available with the surgical fellow or another professor / PI. In addition, proper precautions and training on fake mice should have been implemented first in order to lessen the number of deaths. In other words, the first time students try to inject chemicals into a mouse should not be a real mouse. By the time they've gotten enough practice with fake mice, they would be far more experience and ready for a real one.","I think that for undergraduate medical students, the sacrifices brought about by this kind of practical experience are inevitable. Of course, the poster is not saying that mice should not be used to accumulate experience in clinical experiments, but that it is sad for the unnecessary sacrifice and suffering of animals. This is reasonable, and the way to reduce these harms is that before the actual hands-on operation, researchers can provide similar mouse models for inexperienced researchers to conduct more skill training and psychological preconditioning.","Priority should be given to the participation of trained individuals in such demanding experiments. In other words, alternative experiments should be prioritized if such sacrifices can be reduced."
"I worked with Dr. Z on data analysis that led to my writing a manuscript draft. Dr. Z
assisted with the data analysis but did not own the data and would not be senior author.
Upon reading my manuscript, Dr. Z said it was not acceptable for publication,
whereupon we then worked on it for 6 months. During that time, I would email him
revisions, which would come back with “not good enough” remarks, but little direction
for revision. When I evinced my frustration, he would say we were nearly done and I
just needed to work a little harder to complete it.
At the end of the 6 months, I decided I would leave Dr. Z’s lab. Dr. Z did not take
this at all kindly. In fact, he said some rather unflattering things about my work, and
stated that he wanted to submit the paper himself as first author and not even include
me as an author.
My new lab director Dr. N, who did own the data and to my mind had a clear
claim to being first author from the start, informed me about what Dr. Z was saying. Dr.
N said he felt I had the right to submit the paper myself and that we could remove Dr. Z
completely from authorship—which confused me even more. I wasn’t comfortable
going behind Dr. Z’s back, especially as he had originally made numerous suggestions
affecting the project’s design. But clearly, Dr. Z and Dr. N were at odds and I felt I could
easily get caught in their crossfire.
The primary question I was left with was how to sort this authorship mess out.
Dr. Z, in my mind, certainly deserved some authorship credit, but my current advisor
was disagreeing. Also, he insisted that I be first author, which was flattering but, I
thought, somewhat undeserved. As it turned out, the paper was never submitted. I feel
badly that it wasn’t. How could this mess have been worked out?","I think Dr. Z only wants a higher authorship for himself, and when he didn't make it, he just wanted to trouble you to continuously refine the paper. And Dr. N is also way to extreme for not having Dr. Z on the author list. With this kind of conflict going on, I would say that the paper not published is the best result. When you met this kind of problem, you should go for some university workers who can get contact with both professors, like a student advisor.","Authorship on a paper really should have nothing to do with personal relationships. As a result, both Dr. N and Dr. Z are ethically wrong. Since Dr. Z did contribute a substantial part of the paper, he should at least be an author even though his behavior is less than ideal. Of course, it is even more ridiculous that Dr. Z wanted to make himself the first author and not even add the student as the paper as well. It seems the student was caught between a sour relationship between Dr. N and Dr. Z. The only way out of this situation is to find a compromise between the three people.","I think both professors have certain ethical issues in assigning authorship to the paper. Dr. Z's problem is that the student has invested more than six months on the paper but he does not want the student to be the author; and Dr. N's problem is that due to his tense relationship with Professor Z, he does not want Dr. Z to be named on the paper, even though Dr. Z has made a considerable contribution to the paper. I think the root of this mess lies in the disagreement between Dr. N and Dr. Z. If these disagreements cannot be resolved, then the mess about this paper will be difficult to resolve.",This situation highlights the critical importance of establishing clear authorship agreements early in the research process. Miscommunication and conflicting expectations ultimately prevented valuable work from reaching publication.
"My principal investigator (PI) was preparing a manuscript for publication and had
planned to submit it to a high impact journal. After people in the department were
made aware of the project and of its novelty, it was thought that the manuscript would
likely be accepted.
At that point, my PI was approached by numerous clinicians and postdocs
claiming that they had contributed significantly to this work and should be considered
manuscript authors. Having worked closely with the first author of the project, granting
authorship to these presumptive authors struck me as ridiculous. One of them claimed
authorship because he had provided a common dye reagent. Another, whom we hardly
ever saw in our lab, claimed it was his idea to do certain experiments that were
published in the manuscript—a claim that no one could remember. And there were
others.
Although my PI knew these authorship demands were unfounded, he clearly felt
pressure as a nontenured faculty member to cooperate with certain postdocs because
they had worked in highly productive labs of prominent tenured researchers, and my PI
did not want to sour those relationships. Ultimately, there were a lot of backroom
negotiations and discussions and two additional authors were added to the manuscript.
In my opinion, however, they had contributed nothing to the manuscript.
The paper was eventually accepted in a very influential journal. So it was quite
ironic to have our Medical School, a few months later, publish an editorial chastising the
increasing number of ""phantom"" authors on papers that were being published by the
School's researchers.","It's always vague when it comes to the author list, you only know the sequence of first second third author and etc., but you don't know how much they contribute to the project. It's clearly unethical for the PI to add people to the paper list who basically didn't do anything. Maybe PI just don't have other better ways to maintain the relationship between the clinicians and postdocs.","The shameless people asking for credit on the paper even though they didn't contribute are evidently ethically incorrect. You could also argue that the PI adding those two authors in the end is also in the wrong as well. The inherent problem is that the novel idea was made public to everyone, so everybody tried to get a piece of the pie putting pressure on the PI to accommodate unreasonable takes.","I think the problem described in the above situation is indeed unethical. One of the key points in this issue is that one of the people who claimed to be the author only provided common dye reagents, and such a contribution is indeed not enough to be considered as one of the authors. In addition, another key point is that the reason why the PI added these people as the final authors is that he did not want to destroy the relationship with the laboratory behind them, and this behavior of determining the authorship of the paper based on personal relationships is undoubtedly unethical.","Despite clear authorship guidelines, political considerations often lead to the inclusion of ""phantom"" authors, undermining the credibility of scientific publications."
"This situation occurred shortly after I finished my master’s degree, when I decided to move to
another lab to begin my doctoral work. I chose Dr. Jenkins’s lab because of his well-known
expertise in an area of pharmacokinetics in which I wanted to concentrate my career.
A few weeks after joining the lab, I thought I had made a mistake because I began
feeling somewhat uncomfortable around him. He seemed overly nice and helpful to me, and
he was always trying to be charming and funny. These behaviors struck me as clumsy and
offputting, but in the two years I worked in his lab, he never made any romantic advances or
overtures. Fortunately, as the months went on, I began feeling somewhat more comfortable
around him, and I think he did around me.
The ethical incident that still bothers me involved a small grant that the lab got from a
pharmaceutical company to generate some data on a compound that was of particular interest
to Dr. Jenkins and me. It was agreed and contractually understood that our first manuscript
would be published in one of the pharmaceutical company’s publications rather than a peerreviewed journal. We worked together on the project. While I was in charge of most of the
data generation and interpretation, Dr. Jenkins also ran some experiments and contributed. Or
at least he seemed to. The problem was that by the time I got to the lab later on in the
morning, he had already been there for several hours and he’d give me his data and lab notes.
At the end of a few months, we had generated enough findings to justify our writing the paper,
which we did. And that’s when the surprise came.
As we were adding some finishing touches, Dr. Jenkins said to me, “Mary, I’ve been very
impressed with how you’ve done the lion’s share of this project, so I want you to be the sole
author of this paper. It will be good for your career. I don’t need this publication, but it will
look good on your CV, especially with you as sole author. So, it’s yours. And don’t say I never
gave you anything, ha, ha, ha.”
At first I was really thrilled about this. The only other publication I had was one where I
was included with about a dozen other authors, and I was number 8 or 9 on the author list. I
thought this opportunity would be really cool.
But then I began having second thoughts. Mostly, they involved the fact that I would be
taking credit, as the sole author, for data that I didn’t generate. Would that be a
misrepresentation? Also, Dr. Jenkins from time to time made a suggestion for a modest change
in this or that—which we duly noted in our records and reported to the pharmaceutical
company—and that was fine. But those were his ideas that we incorporated into the protocol,
not mine. Yet, as sole author, I would be taking credit for the whole thing.
As it happened, we did submit the paper with me as sole author. The pharmaceutical
company was fine with it, as long as we acknowledged Dr. Jenkins at the end. Dr. Jenkins was
fine with it, as he really didn’t need the publication (and, maybe, as I look back on it, he didn’t
want his name on a non-peer reviewed publication). I went on from his lab to a satisfying
career. But I’ve always been bothered by this kind of odd turn of authorship events where,
instead of the usual problem of people demanding authorship credit when they don’t deserve
it, here’s an individual who should have been listed as an author but refused.
Any thoughts?","Dr. Jenkins is way too nice in this affair. Although it's normal for people not to be on the authorlist even they worked, in this problem, it's clear that sole author from you is way too much and adding Dr. Jenkins still make this paper a really strong proof of your personal ability.","It seems off that a person who actually contributed the paper doesn't want any credit, but, at the end of the day, it would be more unethical to force the other person to take credit. As a result, everything in this dilemma is ethically correct as the original poster can not force Dr. Jenkins to write his name on the paper and Dr. Jenkins has the right to refuse authorship.","There was nothing unethical about Dr. Jenkins's behavior. Dr. Jenkins did not ask for anything in exchange for the sole authorship, and Mary has a satisfying career in his lab. Moreover, Dr. Jenkins certainly has the right to refuse to be named as a sole author if his motives are justified.","I think there should be clear clarification and communication about the origin of this situation. In principle, there should be an honest division of authorship in order of merit."
"Deciding the order of authors on a manuscript is one of the most common problems
occurring in research, and here is a personal example.
This event occurred early in my graduate school career when one of my first
projects was working alongside Jim, who had been doing graduate work for some time.
Well before I arrived in the lab, Jim and his advisor had outlined and launched a series of
experiments. I then became involved in working on these experiments, first by
acquiring, analyzing and interpreting data and then by designing some of the final
experiments in the study. Subsequently, Jim wrote the majority of the first draft of a
paper we submitted, with him as first author and me second.
While the paper was under review, Jim surprised everyone by abruptly quitting
the graduate program altogether, getting married and moving to a distant city. A few
weeks after his departure, the peer reviews of the paper arrived with the provisional
decision to accept the paper but with major revisions requested. I contacted Jim, who
was now living on the other side of the U.S. He told me he was entirely disinterested in
the project and said he would be unable to contribute to the revision. So, I completed
all the requested revisions, which were quite substantial and included re-analysis and
interpretation of the data (which required some acquisition of new data as well).
At this point, Dr. Simmons who was Jim's advisor, offered me first authorship on
the paper because of my substantial contributions to its reworking and Jim's inability to
do it. I was nevertheless reluctant to accept because the initial conception and design
of the study was Jim's. I discussed this matter with my advisor, who concurred with me
that I should remain second author (which is how the matter ended).
Although I think I made the right decision on this matter, can ethics shed any
particular light on this situation? Jim was responsible for most of the design and
conception of the experiments, ran most of the initial ones and composed most of the
first draft of the paper. But I followed with a tremendous amount of revision and added
new data. While a set of guidelines for authors can be helpful, I’m wondering if such a
set can be particularly helpful in a case like this. ","I think in this affair, Jim has the capability to determine the final authorship of the paper. Because he's responsible for all the beginning part of the paper. A relatively good ending should be you and Jim share first authorship since you made great contribution to the project.","Whether you become first author or not should be dependent on Jim, the current main author, rather than some third party. Since Jim was contacted and agreed he didn't want to work on the project anymore, it seems fine to take the first author as he gave up the responsibility of the paper when he moved away and neglected it. Alternatively, is it insane to suggests that both can be the main author on the paper? It seems like a rather fair compromise.","First of all, I want to say that there is no moral problem with the poster's choice, because it is a choice he made to stick to his own principles. But at the same time, it cannot be ignored that he did put a lot of effort into this paper, and the original first author said that he is not interested in the project now. So I think that perhaps asking the original first author for his opinion may also be a moral choice for the poster.","It is possible to change the author order, but I think it needs to be communicated to and recognized by the original first author."
"A few years ago, I did something distinctly unethical. I was in the process of submitting a paper, which had gone through all its revisions and been approved by all the investigators in the study. Literally at the time I was uploading the paper into the manuscript submission site, I was contacted by one of the investigators. She wanted me to add the names of three more people. They worked in the same department as she, and they all had a mutual agreement to put each other's names on papers they were submitting. These additional “authors” had allowed us to enroll several of their patients for the study, but they only had a general idea of what the study was about and definitely did not contribute anything of intellectual value to the paper. My problem was that I was in no position to say no. Had I denied the request, these individuals could have kept me from completing my thesis which required their assistance to recruit patients. Also, they could have hindered my post-graduate job search. When I discussed all this with my advisor, he agreed that to add their names was unethical, but he too was powerless in dealing with the situation. So, the three were added. To make matters worse, I found out later that the investigators receive bonus money from their department at the end of the year based on publications. I can't help but think such an inducement was in the back of their minds when they all agreed to put each other's names on any research papers they submitted. And maybe the worst part of all this is that if the situation were to arise today with one of my students, I'd probably advise him or her to handle it as I did. The penalties for not playing along, even if the game is unethical, are too uninviting.","In this kind of situation, you should go for the university student advisors to address the problem, since it's unethical and you cannot handle the problem in the way you want and nor do your PI. Though it may break the relationship bbetween your lab and those researchers.","The original poster is very aware that the situation itself is very unethical and that, even though it is, he would still make the same decision again due to the cost of dissenting. Naturally, from an ethical standpoint, the ones shamelessly asking to add their name on the paper are in the wrong. The original poster is also in the wrong for adding the names; however, there is no such thing as a perfectly ethical life. In other words, from an ethical standpoint he is in the wrong, but from a logic standpoint, he is correct.","First of all, this is indeed an unethical thing to do. The main contradiction is that they do not understand the research content, which also violates the rule that paper authorship should not be assigned based on anything other than research contribution. But as the description of the problem says, even his supervisor is unable to solve this matter, let alone as a student. So I think the more reasonable and ethical solution is to continue to report it to researchers with higher positions in the laboratory and ask them for solutions.","One has no choice but to compromise when one is powerless to decide, but this phenomenon taints the integrity and purity of academia."
"Dr. Cooper, a tenure track assistant professor, noted that one of the senior researchers
in his area of research, Dr. Wittgenstein, had recently published an important paper in
the field and had generated some valuable reagents in the process. Cooper contacted
Wittgenstein and asked if he could obtain these reagents, telling Wittgenstein how he
planned to use them. Wittgenstein agreed to send the reagents to Cooper and even
mentioned that he was making additional reagents that might be use for Copper's
future experiments.
After a year of successful experiments using the reagents, Cooper's group wrote a paper
and submitted it to a prestigious journal that rapidly accepted and published it. Shortly
thereafter, Cooper received a phone call from Wittgenstein who asked why his name
had not appeared on the paper. Cooper replied that providing reagents does not merit
an authorship credit. Wittgenstein countered that it is nevertheless common courtesy
to do so and that his lab works incredibly hard to generate these reagents. Wittgenstein
then informed Cooper that he would not share any reagents with him in the future, nor
would he supply him with additional quantities of the original reagents that Cooper
used.
Cooper dismissed this all as a bad experience. Nevertheless, he called several
colleagues who confirmed that while the official rules say that you do not include
people as authors who simply provide reagents, everyone does it.
Over the next several years, Wittgenstein continued to send reagents to other labs who
would include him as an author on their papers. These labs flourished and received
continued funding. Cooper, however, suffered considerably. His having to generate
reagents on his own took over two years, during which time he lost a competitive edge
with other labs. This, in turn, jeopardized Cooper's bid for tenure. On the other hand,
Cooper did consider contacting those journals where Dr. Wittgenstein's name was
appearing and filing numerous complaints, but he dismissed this idea as too uncollegial.
While Dr. Cooper was clearly correct in following rules of authorship credit, it is just as
clear that others weren't. Their's was an ethically dubious reciprocity arrangement
where Wittgenstein's supplying them a reagent would result in his receiving an
authorship credit. Had there been better policing of such arrangements, this sort of
thing would presumably happen less often. But as it presently stood, the consequences
from acting ethically seemed career jeopardizing for the Dr. Coopers of the world, and
career-aggrandizing for the likes of Dr. Wittgenstein. Sadly, as the majority of the
scientific community was inclined to follow the less ethical course, Dr. Cooper found
himself suffering for doing the right thing.
As an aside but to top it all off, Dr. Wittgenstein insisted on authorship credit for himself
but not for his trainees, who did all the work in generating the reagents.
Any ethical suggestions?","It's strongly unethical for a vast majority of the researchers to oblige the authorship rule of the paper to add Dr. Wittgenstein as the author. But everybody is doing this, so this makes Dr. Cooper difficult to disclose everything, and Dr. Cooper is just a professor who is still on his tenure track and may get sacked due to not having enough publications. Maybe it's better to go with the flow first and then after tenure track finished to slowly get rid of this kind of behaviour.","In terms of ethics, Dr. Cooper is in the right as all he did was follow the rules. However, one can not be perfectly ethical at all times and one often (maybe even should) pick the less ethical option if the ethical way comes with too much cost. In this case, Dr. Cooper’s tenure is at stake so it would be logically understandable to write the other guy's name on his paper even if it was against the rules.","Although every researcher will list the person who provided the reagents as the author out of courtesy, it is unethical for Dr. Wittgenstein to force Dr. Copper to add his name to the paper, and he should not retaliate by not providing reagents. But then again, Dr. Copper's laboratory has suffered huge losses because of this behavior, and according to the description of the problem, the reagents provided by Dr. Wittgenstein are also quite valuable, so for Dr. Copper, perhaps trying to find some balance between morality and reality is the best solution.","Dr. Cooper’s experience highlights the unfortunate reality that strict adherence to ethical authorship standards can sometimes disadvantage individuals in a system that informally rewards unethical reciprocity. Without stronger community enforcement, those who prioritize integrity are often penalized, while those who exploit the system thrive."
"I had an upsetting experience a few years ago in gathering data and preparing a
manuscript. At first, everything was going fine: I was working as a research assistant,
and my professor and the rest of the research team were nicely in synch. As we laid out
everyone’s responsibilities for the experiment, it was decided that I would be primary
author and the professor last author. As we ended our data collection and proceeded to
analyze it, my professor hired another faculty member in our department, a statistician,
and asked the statistician to look at the paper. The statistician did and made some
recommendations that were easily incorporated. Some months then went by, but my
professor did not submit it. When I asked him why, he said that the statistician had
decided to rewrite it. The real surprise came some weeks later when my professor told
me that the paper was finished, but that the statistician had put so much time on it that
she had convinced him that she should be first author.
I was quite upset but I respected the professor and went along. My question is,
“Can one rewrite a paper with data that is not your own and claim first authorship?” I
was the agreed upon first author, so technically it was my call to decide if someone
should be listed as an author or just acknowledged. But as a graduate student, what
clout did I have against a faculty member? The politics of the department seemed to
trash the initial agreement about the order of authorship. And I would say that that was
unethical, wouldn’t you?","The statistician should have that much capability to do the whole thing from the beginning. If he wanted to do so, he should also remind to talk with the students and PI about the author issue and claim his work instead of just rewrite everything without everybody's notice and claim that he had done tons of work.","This situation is filled with unethical behavior starting from the fact that the statistician rewrote the paper without the main author’s opinion! It’s even more ludicrous that the professor becomes the first author after the fact that the statistician rewrote the paper! To answer the questions, if the author were to rewrite the paper with significant enhancements and with the knowledge of the primary author, you could make the case for said author to become the main author. In this scenario, however, neither of those things happened. As a graduate student, the only thing you can do is to find a better professor, which, of course, is easier said than done.","This is indeed unethical. The point here is that the statistician's suggestions are all easily adopted, so the contribution of rewriting a paper with other people's data should be far less than data collection and analysis. In addition, it is worth noting that the poster and the professor and other researchers in the laboratory have already reached an agreement on the order of authors, and this behavior of overturning the previous agreement without prior notice should not be accepted just because the professor has greater power in the laboratory.","Rewriting a manuscript without contributing to the underlying research does not ethically justify claiming first authorship. This situation reflects an abuse of power dynamics, where initial authorship agreements are disregarded at the expense of more vulnerable junior researchers."
"The research I was doing involved working with tissue samples from a large number of
patient-donors that were collected over the course of 20 years. IRB approval for
acquiring specimens and protocols were obtained according to institutional and federal
government guidelines and the study proceeded without incident. Indeed, the lab
published several important papers in the field and, of course, maintained the privacy
and confidentiality of all donors.
But one day when I was well into my work, I was nonchalantly informed by one
of the principal investigators in the lab of the identity of one of the donors of our
specimens. The donor was a highly visible, nationally known celebrity.
I never found out how this investigator came to know this tissue donor's identity.
To my knowledge, the only information that the laboratory staff had was their donor's
age, sex, and race. In fact, none of the laboratory's documentation described any donor
in any specific terms. Nevertheless, and as result of this revelation, I was faced with the
problem of deciding whether or not to continue to conduct research using cells derived
from this individual. This was especially problematic for me because this donor's cells
had been very useful to me, yielding promising and exciting data up to that point.
Ultimately, I decided that it would be inappropriate for me to continue
conducting experiments using cultures from cells derived from this person. But I
wonder if I was being ""too ethical."" Was I?","I think you can still use this donors samples, as long as the donor has capable health conditions that meets your research's needs. I think it's ethical to continuie to use as long as you don't disclose the donor's identity, after all, I don't think every paper disclose their testers' personal information.","As long as you think the identity would not skew the results, there shouldn’t be any reason not to use the data, unless the patient, who should be notified that their identity was leaked, is against it. A breach of confidentiality is a big deal not for the people in the lab, but for the person who got their information leaked. Consequently, the PI should notify the patient of such a breach and go from their decision.","First of all, I think the key to the problem is that the laboratory should inform the donor of the current situation, that is, a small number of researchers already know the identity of the donor. After the truth is told, if the donor agrees that the researchers continue to use the sample, then it is not unethical to use the sample without revealing the donor's sample and identity in the paper.",I don't think it's inappropriate to continue to use this celebrity's cells; it's not unethical.

"My graduate thesis involved developing an assay to determine if light-activated
metalloporphyrins could kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the assay could validly and reliably
show significant bacterial cell death, then the compounds we were evolving would present a
possible alternative treatment for Pseudomonas infections, especially in burn patients.
Developing the assay, then, was key to finding a reliable way to test a large number of
candidate compounds and to identify the ones with the greatest lethality to the bacterium.
After developing and reworking various assays, I evolved a method for determining the
killing efficiency of light-activated metalloporphyrins that could be performed in duplicate or
triplicate in each trial. The first trial showed extensive bacterial cell death in all experimental
groups, but the second repetition showed little or no cell death. Much to my delight, a third
trial confirmed the results of our first trial.
At this point, I approached my advisor and requested permission to write my thesis with
these results. He felt, however, that we needed to obtain the same results in two consecutive
trials. Much to my surprise and dismay, a fourth and fifth trial showed no bacterial cell death.
Consequently, we could not verify the original results, and I began an extensive troubleshooting
process to determine if either the assay was defective or if the metalloporphyrins were
ineffectual bacteriocidal agents.
Further trials, which were time-consuming and laborious, nevertheless resulted in more
accurate data and, thankfully, prevented us from making embarrassingly inaccurate
conclusions. It also eliminated the need to test a large number of other candidate compounds
with an ineffective assay—which would have resulted in an even greater waste of time and
materials than simply repeating our experiment a few extra times. Consequently, I not only
took away from my thesis experience a better grasp of the scientific process, but an
understanding of the ethical importance of patience, verification, and the reporting of reliable
experimental data. ",,,,"You can't fool around with research, and patience is a crucial part of the equation. You have to make your conclusions convincing."
"Some years ago I was completing my undergraduate degree and was working in Dr. Allen’s lab. I very much wanted to go on to graduate school and was looking to my project—a fairly sophisticated one I was doing with a post-doc—to get me admitted to the graduate program I had in mind. I was also counting on Dr. Allen, who was pretty well known in the field, to write me a nice letter of recommendation. Unfortunately, my project yielded no significant data. I wasn’t terribly bothered by this as I felt the results were still reportable—maybe even, given the nature of the research, “significant” in a nonstatistical way. Dr. Allen, however, could not have disagreed more. He said I would have to write a report on this project and that he wouldn’t have a report coming out of his lab with no statistically significant findings. He told me to go on a “fishing expedition” and perform a bunch of ad hoc analyses in the hopes of finding some correlations that were statistically significant. Because I was taking a statistics course at the same time, I knew what Dr. Allen was asking me to do was experimentally unsound and, therefore, unethical. What a dilemma: I needed to turn in the report to graduate, and I needed Dr. Allen’s letter of recommendation. If I questioned him on it, I was afraid he’d throw me out of his lab. I talked to my post-doc for advice, and she agreed that the fishing expedition, also termed “data torturing,” was unsound. But she wouldn’t go to Dr. Allen on my behalf. So, I decided not to make any waves. I managed to find a few correlations that were statistically significant, wrote my report, and graduated with a letter of recommendation from Dr. Allen. I rationalized the whole thing by thinking, “Who was I to be questioning someone who had been doing research for so many more years than I?” Also, Dr. Allen never struck me as a devious person. I strongly suspect he didn’t think there was anything wrong with the fishing expedition. Of course, the primary reason I went along was fear of retaliation and damage to my career prospects. I’d imagine there are many individuals who can relate stories similar to mine. What should institutions do to prevent this kind of thing from happening?","I understand the fact that you want the recommendation letter from the professor, but I think you still cannot do such kind of things. First, reporting this kind of things to the professor already gives him a bad impression, which may affect the quality of the recommendation letter you expected. Second, this is an unethical thing to do and it's not contributing to the academic environment.","From the original poster’s perspective, he was already aware that the scenario is ethical, but still it was logically sound to go with it anyway assuming his ad-hoc research wasn’t totally nonsense. However, a large part of research is repeatability. After the graduate thesis is done, the lab should continue to further recreate the findings and actually determine if the correlation between them is real or not.","I think this situation is more due to the requirements of the school or the outside world on Dr. Allen or the laboratories. The most direct evidence is that Dr. Allen said that his laboratory would not issue a report without statistically significant findings. Perhaps it is the high requirements of the outside world for his laboratory that led Dr. Allen to demand such output from his laboratory. So I think that in addition to adding the practical significance of reviewing the reports of each laboratory, the solution to this problem may also lie in reducing the rigid quantity requirements of the outside world on each laboratory to ensure the practical significance of the research.","You should tell your mentor what you think. But in this case, I think most people would compromise."
"Deleting data points is hardly uncommon. You print out all the data points on a scatter plot,
and then see that there are a few points way over in left field (or lower right field) or anywhere
but where they should be. This is such a familiar situation in research that statisticians have
actually worked out strategies that describe how to delete these “funky” data.
This would imply that there are certain situations in which the practice is OK. But there
are clearly instances where such deletion amounts to misrepresentation. What are the
boundaries or criteria that distinguish ethical from unethical deletion of data?",Ethical data deletion requires the statisticians to explain what points do they deleted and why do they delete the things. Unethical data deletion is result centric and delibrate.,"It is ethical to delete data when you believe the data collected is due to some factor that has nothing to do with the underlying distribution. For example, if the machinery simply broke for a few data points or data points that don’t make sense logically (like a negative age), those points should be removed as they are misrepresentative of what the data is. However, it is unethical to delete a few data points just to make your correlation look better.","I think the most critical distinction here is whether the scatter plot displayed by deletion or not changes the original conclusion of the experiment. In addition, no matter how the researchers modify the scatter plot, they should reflect this in their paper and clearly explain the reasons and their impact. Only in this way can it be done without violating ethical standards.","Deleting data points can be ethically acceptable when done according to predefined, transparent criteria that are scientifically justified. However, selectively removing data to produce cleaner or more favorable results constitutes a serious breach of research integrity."
"Jack and Jill are graduate students, working at the same university but in different labs.
They are friends and frequently discuss their projects, which are often along similar
lines. One day, Jill tells Jack about her progress and discloses a lot of details about her
experimental design and data. However, she mentions to Jack that she has gotten stuck
and can’t move forward because her lab doesn’t have the resources to move her work
along. Jack, as it turns out, is not only very interested in Jill’s work, but his lab is well
supported, and his professor likes him and would support Jack’s ideas. Without telling
Jill, Jack spends the next few months working out his own version of Jill’s experiment
with great support from his advisor. He then publishes an important paper which Jill
had no idea about until she sees it appear in a high impact journal.
Perhaps one can argue that Jack did not steal Jill’s work because he did not
include any of Jill’s data in his paper. But was it ethical of him to dismiss Jill’s
contribution altogether since Jack’s work derived totally from Jill’s original conceptual
design and ideas? His experimental design was entirely Jill’s and was inspired by Jill’s
preliminary work.
Should Jack at least have acknowledged Jill’s contribution at the end of his
paper? Should he have included her as an author? Should he have suggested
collaborating with her from the start?","I think Jack should suggest Jill to work with him from the start. Even acknowledgement at the end of the paper is also not enough for Jill's contribution. Maybe adding Jill as the author, if agreed by Jill, was a way to make up jill's loss.","The idea itself is a large part of a research paper and should not be taken without permission from the original author.  Another factor to consider is that Jill’s work seemed to already have substantial progress; it’s not some loose ideas that haven’t been applied yet.Consequently, Jack should for sure have included Jill as an author for the final paper. In fact, more than that, Jack should have kept Jill in the loop of his project as he seems to be straight up stealing.","Perhaps we can say that Jack did not steal Jill's work, but Jack's behavior is undoubtedly unethical. I think Jack should have suggested Jill to collaborate with him at the beginning, and the remedy for now is to list Jill as a co-author or add her to the acknowledgments according to Jill's wishes.","Jack shouldn't do this without informing Jill. Also, Jill's contributions should be included in related papers. Jack violated Jill's right of ideas."
"A basic scientist temporarily discontinued the development of a measles treatment after the approval of a
highly effective measles vaccine. However, due to the anti-vaccine movement as well as logistical
barriers in underserved countries, it has become clear that the vaccine will not achieve global eradication.
Therefore, given the current measles epidemic, the scientist has decided to resume efforts towards the
development of the investigational treatment and submit a grant. His plan is to first conduct a phase 1
clinical trial in healthy adults and then to proceed to a phase 1 trial in children with measles. Since one of
the few places that children regularly get measles is in developing countries such as India, he would like
to conduct the pediatric trial in India. He is proposing a trial that raises three ethical concerns: (1)
measles, though it can have long term adverse events such as reduced hearing, is not usually fatal so the
risk/ benefit analysis is not easy; (2) he wants to do a trial in sick individuals in the pediatric setting; (3)
he wants to do the trial in India. The requestor asked for this research consult to help with writing a grant
to fund the clinical trial.
Background:
In 2018, globally, there were 9,759,400 cases of measles, with nearly 140,000 deaths. These statistics demonstrate that there is a current measles epidemic that needs to be addressed. Even in the United States, a first-world country in which the measles was declared eradicated in 2000, cases have been on the rise due to travel and transmission to unvaccinated individuals. The United States reported 1,282 cases in 2019—the highest since 1992. However, the majority of cases are found in poorer countries who have limited access to the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccines, with the most recent CDC report showing India leading the world with the highest number of cases during a one-month period. Limited access to the vaccine in third-world countries contributes to these high statistics and highlights that despite the fact that a vaccine exists for measles, the current rise in cases demands a treatment that can help mitigate the effects of this deadly and debilitating disease.
","I think this type of experiment need to ask the local's permissions. Maybe measles still means something to the testers and they wanted to get rid of the disease with any attempt. Also, it ethical to test on local testers if you are aiming to help the locals, on the basis of permission.","Since the scientist hasn’t even started his experiments, there is obviously nothing unethical going around. However, if he were to commit to this plan, he must abide by India’s laws rather than the U.S., get explicit consent from all the patients, and have enough safety precautions that there is no risk.","As with all issues involving requesting subjects to participate in clinical trials, the key to this issue is to truthfully inform potential subjects of the significance and risks of participating in clinical trials and respect their wishes. I believe that if the above can be achieved, then the research is ethical.",Subjects' interests should be assured and they need to be informed of the potential risks.
"This dilemma, which is a not uncommon one, involves the risks and benefits of
expediting approval for a promising drug.
Some years ago, I worked at a pharmaceutical company and was involved in
Phase III cancer trials among patients whose disease had returned. These patients had a
poor prognosis, but a drug we were working on showed that the median survival rate
among the (small group of) patients on the new drug was increased by 5 months. A
press release and journal article were prepared and, very rapidly, patient advocacy
groups began demanding access to the drug prior to FDA approval.
Once a Phase III trial is completed with results that show sufficient efficacy for
FDA approval, it often takes 6 months to 1 year to complete a filing package for the FDA
to review, followed by a year before the FDA rules on the drug. So, at a minimum it
would take 18 months for approval, meaning that patients who were currently being
diagnosed with cancer relapse would probably not be alive when or if the drug
appeared. The question therefore was: Could this process be expedited without the loss
of data integrity?
While the consequence of routine filing time to desperate patients is obvious, a
shortened filing for the pharmaceutical company can mean the loss of data that might
be necessary for approval and that could bolster (or diminish) the validity of the efficacy
claims. The consequences to the FDA were that taking too long to have the drug
approved can look very unsympathetic to the patients who need it, while taking too
short a time could potentially put an unsafe drug on the market.
Obviously, both the FDA and the pharmaceutical company have legal obligations
to ensure that the drug was reasonably safe and effective. But they also have a moral
obligation to provide the medication as rapidly as possible to patients. What kinds of
considerations, therefore, need to occur in order to achieve the best of both ethical
obligations?","I think this needs further regulations applied from FDA. If the patients are at serious risk, and their family or the patient itself gave the doctor's the permission to use drugs on test for the treatment, then I think it's ethical for the doctors to provide not FDA permitted but test-proved medicine to the patients. After all, there have been more testers before this process when actually doing the experiment.",I mean what else is there to do except have the FDA work more efficiently by either putting other cases on hold or hiring more manpower. ,"I think this problem can be solved from two angles. One is to shorten the unnecessary approval process as much as possible to help patients in critical condition get drug treatment as soon as possible; the other is to provide patients in critical condition with the choice of whether to receive new treatments before obtaining FDA approval. In this process, some information/risk transparency should be achieved, and all information about the drug should not be concealed from potential subjects. After the patient understands the specific information and weighs the pros and cons according to his or her own situation, the patient can choose to skip FDA approval and use the drug in advance. I think this is an ethical approach because it does not deprive patients of any rights, but provides patients in critical condition with an additional choice and even hope of life.","If patients are willing to take the risk and the situation is more urgent, approval should be expedited. If the risks of the drug are difficult to bear, approval should be cautious."
"Background: Improvements in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are progressively
being incorporated into both research and clinical practices, allowing rapid genetic diagnoses at a
cheaper cost. However, studies using NGS or whole-exome sequencing often encounter an ethical
dilemma in how to contact study participants in the case that they discover an incidental and medically
actionable finding. First, there must be a process for determining what to return and the means for
doing so. Secondly, such findings must be retested clinically to ensure valid results. The American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) suggests that clinical diagnostic laboratories that
perform either whole-exome or genome sequencing should report, at minimum, any positive result for
the 56 known pathogenic or expected pathogenic variant genes as incidental or secondary findings, even
when unrelated to the primary medical reason for testing.
Scenario: In a specific study, researchers were performing NGS on tissue banked samples of
healthy controls and colon cancer patients to validate an assay. The use of healthy controls in a study
like this is not uncommon; however, what happens if one of the healthy controls tests positive for a
mutation that predisposes to colon cancer using an unvalidated research assay? The samples were
obtained from a tissue bank and the researchers were unclear about what the informed consent stated
about returning incidental findings, raising the question whether to contact the subject and if contact is
attempted, how to do it.","I think it's still worth mentioning the testers about this issue. Although this is still experimental stage and it may not happen to the testers, informing the details of the medical test and the direct message to the testers is needed. Also, it's unethical to not telling the testers about the detail because if they really do have the disease in the future, they may blame the researchers conducting the test back in that time ahve caused the problem.","First of all, there are exceptions to many laws in the event that a life can be saved. Consequently, I think action should be taken to notify the subject. In the best case scenario, the lab should notify the patient without knowing the identity of the patient, which can be done by a large broadcast message, for example. ","I believe that it is necessary to inform the subjects of all the circumstances, including the mutations that predispose to colon cancer, and that the researchers' current research methods are unvalidated. In addition to alerting the subjects to their risk of colon cancer and going to relevant medical institutions for detailed examinations, informing the subjects of the limitations of their research methods can also reduce the subjects' concerns while ensuring ethics.","Researchers have an ethical obligation to attempt recontact if a medically actionable incidental finding is discovered, even if the assay is unvalidated, provided proper confirmation testing is performed. However, this must be balanced with respecting the original informed consent terms and ensuring that any recontact process prioritizes the subject's autonomy and well-being."
"A hospital is proposing the implementation of a concierge primary care practice, which provides patients with a breadth of healthcare services not covered by normal insurance. This model would require patients to pay $1500 to $3000 a year for access to a physician who will be a part of the concierge group at the institution. In addition, patients will receive comprehensive healthcare services, including 24-hour physician availability, expedited appointments, longer care visits, and preventive care not typically reimbursed by insurance. Physicians will be able to volunteer to treat patients on this service. While the hospital believes this model will offer high quality, comprehensive primary care services to its patients, they are faced with the dilemma of whether the model is ethically sound. Many hospitals offer a concierge model of primary care, but this group is concerned that they may contribute to large-scale health inequities, such as limiting access to primary care to those who cannot pay the extra fees or exacerbating the nationwide shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs).","Though hospitals can get the extra profit from healthcare, it's unethical to allocate all the hospital resources to these people who get paid. For example, when a doctor is checking a normal patient, it shouldn't be forced to switch to provide service for a prioritized patient who just came to the hospital. Instead, the healthcare should allocated a few doctors to service the concierge primary care buyers, and still keep a majority of the doctors to work for the public.","Well the main argument is that with more money, the hospital can save more lives and hire more people, so they could aid more of the “common man”. In addition, it is undeniably that there are “more important” people, such as the president, that will need some sort of a premium hospital experience. Although practically sound, if this were to impede the aid of the common man rather than improving it, it is very unethical.","This medical service model is indeed not very ethical. Although this model does provide better services to patients who pay for it, it cannot be ignored that it undoubtedly occupies more medical resources. The medical resources of the entire medical institution are limited, so this medical service model potentially reduces the medical treatment enjoyed by patients who cannot afford the extra fees.","In fact, this model affects the fairness of the visit."
"I'm a pediatric oncologist who inherited a research project from a colleague. The project involved a one-time phlebotomy draw of 2 to 4 milliliters of blood from a pediatric population aged 3 to 21 years. These research participants are recruited from the regular patient population of our clinic who come for routine blood draws on their medical visits. The problem we encountered involved the work flow of our clinic. Before our patients arrived, I would review the list of who is coming in that day for regular clinic visits and decide if the patient was eligible for the blood study research project. Very frequently, however, and before I would see a newly arrived patient, a Tech would weigh the patient and draw blood per his or her routine visit. I usually had a very hard time catching the patient before the Tech did the blood draw, so I regularly found myself asking the patient and his or her family member for permission to be enrolled in the study that would then require the unpleasantness of a second venipuncture. Even when I did get to the patient before the Tech did, the informed consent conversation would be rushed and they would have to decide quickly if we could draw some extra blood. It then occurred to us that if we would simply draw an additional 2-4 milliliters of blood at the time of the Tech's routine blood draw, these problems would be solved. Once the blood is drawn and I subsequently see the patient, I could explain to the patient and his or her family member that we would use some of the blood that had just been taken. If they refused participation, we just wouldn’t use their blood in the study. This approach seemed much kinder to the patient in precluding the need for a second venipuncture; the patient and his or her family would not be delayed any further; and having already secured their blood, we thought it more likely that patients would consent to participating. The strategy seemed to present a clear win-win situation. Does it?","This is not a ethical strategy. Instead, you should told the patient about this experiment from the start and then ask whether you join the experiment to decide whether to take more blood or not.","This does not seem very ethical as you are drawing more blood than necessary without consent. You should instead ask the patient before you draw blood if it’s okay to use the blood for some other study not after. If they say yes, knowing now that you will draw more blood, then you are able to draw the extra blood.","I think this method does bring a lot of convenience to researchers and patients, and it also avoids secondary venipuncture for patients. This method itself is acceptable, but from an ethical point of view, I think this method can be improved: for example, before drawing blood, inform the patient or his family of the specific requirements of the experiment, and inform them that an additional 2-4 ml of blood will be drawn. If the patient or his family does not agree to the experiment, the normal process will be followed; if they agree, an additional 2-4 ml will be drawn. This ensures that the patient only needs to undergo a single venipuncture while maintaining the ethics of the process.","While minimizing patient discomfort is important, collecting research blood before obtaining informed consent undermines ethical standards and compromises the principle of voluntary participation"
"We were conducting a pilot study in an area of the U.S. that had a large Hispanic population. I must emphasize that this was a “very” pilot project, funded entirely by our department. The data being gathered were extremely preliminary and would not benefit research participants in any way. In fact, it would probably be more correct to say that this was a “pre-pilot” study although it was approved by our IRB, of course. The problem occurred when Hispanic, would-be enrollees started showing up in our research offices without a consent form. This would occasionally happen because the informed consent translator would not be available, and the participants would be sent directly to research. But when that happened, we had no one available in the research unit to go over or “translate” the Spanish consent form into something the participants could understand. (Many of them were illiterate.) Because this became increasingly problematic, we decided to exclude Hispanics from the study altogether. A member of our research team was disturbed by this, however, saying that we were denying this population a possible “benefit.” Furthermore and intuitively, the wholesale exclusion of Hispanics certainly sounded discriminatory. I continue to wonder about this. Is there a right or a duty to participate in research? Was our exclusion of Hispanics in this study ethically defensible?","This is not ethical. If you are doing the experiment where a vast majority of the people are hispanic, you should figure out the communication problem and formally told the testers about the experiment. Simply blocking them out not only reduces the data but also is a kind of discrimination.","This is actually quite discriminatory because the study made it about race, which is obviously unethical. However, if the prerequisite was “they must know english”, then I think it is ethically defensible in this case because this research seems like more of a proof of concept rather than an actual study. If the study itself has nothing to do with language, then there shouldn’t be any need and taking a “sort of” convenience sample is fine. It seems that there was an effort to accommodate (but again, why make it about race?), but alas research is always bared by funding and truly random samples simply don't exist (you are not traveling to Asia to get a truly random sample for example).
","I think this is unethical. Excluding Hispanics for the sake of convenience in the research process not only sounds discriminatory, but it is also unethical. In addition, since the research team is conducting the experiment in a region of the United States with a large Hispanic population, it is also the responsibility of the research team to solve the communication barriers in advance. More importantly, excluding Hispanic subjects in a region with a large Hispanic population is likely to affect the results of the experiment.","Excluding an entire population due to logistical barriers, even in a low-risk study, raises serious ethical concerns about fairness and equal access to research participation."
"This dilemma occurred when I was completing my masters degree. I was collecting data in a very impoverished country, whose culture and language were immensely different from mine (i.e., the U.S). I signed onto the project shortly after the research proposal had been developed, funding was secured, and the protocol was vetted by both my university's IRB and the host country's. My job was to choose the site, recruit and retain subjects, and obtain baseline and endline blood samples. We experienced recruitment problems right away. Many of our participants were illiterate, and so had to have the consent form read and explained. Also, some distrusted us and thought we were there to harm them. At the study's end, it was necessary to collect blood samples. We had lost about 15 percent of the original sample for various reasons and therefore needed samples from all those still enrolled. I wasn't worried, though. I was confident we had assured those participants who might initially have had doubts about participating, and all the participants benefited from getting extra medical care and, often, free medicine. We also held ceremonies to honor and recognize them, and even had the study ""blessed"" by local religious heads. So, it was quite a surprise when only 50 percent of the participants arrived at our make-shift clinic for their final blood draw. In something of a panic, we decided that instead of waiting for them to come to us, we would take our equipment and go to their houses. If they did not want to give us a blood sample, they could tell us at their doorsteps. Did our strategy constitute an unacceptable level of coercion? I must say I wasn't entirely comfortable with it. Here we were, doctors and professionals in the field, arriving on their doorsteps with our lab coats on and all the equipment necessary to draw blood—wouldn't this make it harder for them to say ""No""? And if we did make it harder, were we then violating their right to be left alone and refuse participation (a right guaranteed them when they initially consented to participate)? In any event, the strategy worked. We were able to obtain enough samples to make our data credible. And after talking with other, more experienced researchers about blood sampling in other countries, I found that our strategy was not uncommon at all—that collecting enough data from certain nonwestern populations can be very difficult and that you do whatever is ethically reasonable to get the job done. In fact, we did have some participants deny our requests for a final blood draw, indicating that there was still ample opportunity for participants to withdraw. I nevertheless wonder whether our strategy crossed the ethical line of respecting our participants' right to refuse.","The conducted experiment does considered the problem of the testers, but still needs some kind of improvements to be ethical. The research team should hire locals to ask the residents whether they want to take part in the experiment, this can relieve the problems of professionals scaring locals and force them to join the experiment.","It’s somewhat ethically gray only because many foreign doctors can come off as pretty intimidating to a vulnerable population. I do agree that they must find a way to get the job done, but they could have, for example, asked another local to go to their houses while they waited somewhere out of sight. Other than that, because they all had acknowledged consent, it was ethically fine.","I think this practice is not disrespectful to the participants, nor does it exceed the ethical boundary of respecting the participants' right to refuse. Potential participants have the right to refuse, and researchers naturally have the right to attract as many potential participants as they can, not to mention that this practice does not actually deprive potential participants of their right to refuse. Of course, we have to admit that this practice may indeed scare potential subjects, so perhaps it may be more appropriate to hire a local to lead the door-to-door visits to improve this practice.",Directly approaching participants at home risks undermining their voluntary consent by creating subtle coercion.
"A patient is handed a consent form to allow their tissue samples to be used for current and future research. However, before signing the final page, the patient has one request: they would like to edit the form before finalizing their agreement to participate. The patient does not want to give up ownership of their tissue, but still very much wants to participate. The patient would like to write, “I retain ownership of all tissue” on the hard copy form of consent and then sign it. Confused about the legality and permissibility of the patient editing the consent form, the research coordinator requests a research ethics consult.","It is ethical for the patient to require having his own tissue's property, but the form has to be changed. If there's only a few patient, they may be able to add the regulations and ask all people to re-sign the form. But on the otherhand, patient can say no to the experiment since the form is vague about the tissue's ownership after extracted.","Last second edits to contracts are actually a fairly common thing that happens in other fields relating to real estate or law, and, more often than not, the new text is accepted and, of course, saved. The fact that some text is written down does not “unlegitimize” that section of text. If they are not in a rush, they could also just reprint the document with the new line.","I don't think there is anything wrong with patients making such requests. At the same time, the research team also has the right to decide whether to accept the request. This situation can be directly negotiated between the patient and the research team: if the research team agrees to the request, the patient's tissue can be used for the experiment; otherwise, the patient's specific opinion needs to be asked and further communication is needed.",Minor changes are humane if they are reasonable and reflect the mutual wishes of both parties.
"A few years ago during my post-Doc, I had an advisor who seemed just plain nuts. Psychiatrists might label him “narcissistic,” “paranoid,” “compulsive,” “anti-social,” “emotionally disregulated,” but I think he was crazy. He’d lash out at students; pound his desk in anger; and threaten to refuse to pay work-study students. While I was working on my project, he’d call me sometimes late at night—twice around midnight—with suggestions. He’d drag on some students’ theses interminably. Nevertheless, I don’t think he ever really “damaged” anyone significantly; he was just very peculiar and unpredictable. And many people found it impossible to work for him. After weighing the pro’s and con’s of leaving the group, I decided to stick it out unlike several other students who came with a smile but left aghast at what they experienced. However, some students did not leave without first filing formal complaints about my advisor’s behavior with the Dean. Twice, I was asked to testify to the concerns of these students. Knowing that my advisor would destroy me if I said anything negative about him, I hedged and was vague on the really probing questions. After completing my post-Doc, I was asked again to write an evaluation of this nutty professor, and I was kind. The dilemma is that if I said anything bad about him, I would be kissing a good recommendation good-bye. However, if I didn’t say anything negative, my advisor’s nuttiness would probably continue. So, my self-interest won out. Now, I always have a good recommendation letter whenever needed. And if I had to do it all over again, I’d do the same thing. In fact, I understand this professor’s behavior has improved, probably as a result of the investigation. So, all’s well that ends well. Had I formally complained, it would have cost me more than I could afford. As I said, if I had to do it all over again, I’d do the same thing.","I think you should go to the university student care center or similar agencies to report this problem and your dilemma. It is understandable that you want to keep your carrer stable, but doing this doesn't help to solve the elephant in the room.","It sounds like the original poster is well aware that he is being unethical, but logically so as it would cost him quite a bit to tell the truth. In an event like this, if being ethical is the goal, it would probably be smarter to start probing other labs or professors to try and jump ship to escape the crazy professor. That way, you get a recommendation letter that is just as good, while not having to lie about the professors behavior.","From a practical point of view, your approach is reasonable and in your own interest. But from an ethical point of view, it is irresponsible to everyone except you and the tutor. As you said, he will cause psychological and physical harm to the students, and being vague in the testimony is undoubtedly covering up the tutor's harmful behavior.","Preserving yourself is understandable, it's what most people do. The problems of such an environment in academic circles are exemplified."
"Dr. Stupendous was world-renowned—a fact that he reminded himself and his staff of every day. One reason that he was world-renowned is because his post-docs worked like maniacs and turned out an endless stream of manuscripts and grants. Dr. Stupendous was quite a motivator, which brings up the ethical problem I observed. Every year, Stupendous hired at least 3 post-docs and frankly told them at their hiring that they would all be assigned to the same project. Whoever was first to produce a manuscript that, in his opinion, was ready for publication would be asked to stay. The others would be asked to leave at the end of their commitment. The latters’ letters of recommendation would be based upon the amount of progress they made in the time they had remaining in the lab. While I suppose competition is a healthy thing, Stupendous’s version of it struck me as both sadistic and somewhat lunatic. It’s hard to imagine a laboratory marked by collegiality and trust, given Stupendous’s ground rules. But, alternatively, science is keenly competitive and his strategy certainly seemed to make for a work ethic whose productivity was the envy of every lab at the University. Still, I don’t think I’d want to do a post-doc with this guy. Is this the way hiring and productivity rules for post-docs should be laid down?",I don't think this competition scheme should become the way of choosing postdocs. The Dr. Stupendous's behaviour was simply wasting other two of the postdocs' resources to do nothing. There must be a more humane and ethical way to choosing between contestants. Maybe adding more steps in the process of choosing and interviewing postdocs can help to find better person.,"Dr. Stupendous method is fine when it comes to pitting the post-docs against each other as this is normally pretty common within companies with limited head counts (they are just less straightforward about it). The problem, however, is that they are all working independently on the same project, which seems like a lot of wasted effort from the two others. Additionally, if we want to maximize productivity in the lab, wouldn’t it be better for them to collaborate and just set harsher deadlines? Finally, there is a lot more merit to a person than just how fast they can create a manuscript, so his recommendation letter method and evaluation method is quite stupid.
","I don't think Dr. Stupendous's behavior is unethical. Although such competition is indeed crazy and cruel, this is Dr. Stupendous's working style, and I think the postdocs who apply for positions in his laboratory will also know this. After knowing this, choosing to accept Dr. Stupendous' offer and enter his laboratory to compete is their personal choice, not forced by Dr. Stupendous' competition model.","It's sick, unhealthy competition. Instead of getting the recognition they deserve, people are being overpowered."
"I did my undergraduate work in a biological research lab that was proud to host numerous high school students throughout the year. Each student would learn basic microbiological techniques by isolating and characterizing novel viruses from the environment. Many would use this experience for a high school graduation project. One time during the Spring semester, the coordinator of this program received an e-mail from a local high school student who stated he was working with us for his senior high school science project. He inquired in the e-mail if he could ask the coordinator some questions about the program. The coordinator responded affirmatively, so the student followed up with a list of questions. Upon reading the questions, however, the coordinator was struck by the fact that they were not the type of questions that a student who participated in the program would ask, e.g., “What does your program do?” “What building is your program located in?” So, the coordinator became suspicious as to whether the student actually set foot in the lab to do the work he claimed he was doing. So we investigated. We searched for notebooks with his name on it, his name in the time logs, and his initials on community reagents. We went back through old emails to see if he had been assigned a mentor to work with us. Our efforts turned up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence that this student had performed the work he claimed to have done. After a brief discussion on whether we should notify the student’s teacher, we did. In fact, we contacted both the teacher and the principal. We explained that we had no evidence that this student had ever worked with us, and if he claimed to have done so for a high school project, he was lying. As it turned out, the student had indeed claimed to have worked with our lab, and he fabricated the data on his project as well. The high school required him to redo the project, which meant he couldn’t graduate that Spring. It seems to me our decision to contact the high school was entirely proper. Do you agree?","I think it's right for you to do so. If you are faking your experiments, you deserve the punishment of not able to graduate on time. But, you can also come up with a way of making this student to get a lower score compared to other students who actually worked in the lab so that the student can still graduate on time and there's gap between him and hardworking students.","Yes. This is falsification through and through. In fact, you might even be doing the kid a favor as if he were to pull off a stunt like this in college, the consequences could be significantly more severe. ","I agree with the decision. I believe the student's fraudulent behavior was disrespectful to the biological research laboratory. Since he falsified data and lied, he should bear full responsibility for the consequences, which naturally includes requiring him to complete the project again and delay graduation.",It is right to ask such questions and use official channels to generate contacts. This upholds honesty and fairness.
"Some years ago, a graduate student obtained some funding from an external, private source that would support his stipend, enable him to travel, and, very importantly, allow him to purchase supplies (e.g., cells and reagents) for his research. This funding came as a considerable relief because the University had recently had to assume significant budget cuts in research programs, and the student anticipated needing some expensive materials for his research. As the student tried to move his project forward, however, he was stymied by the PI (who was also the lab director) who refused the student’s requests for supplies and reagents. The PI explained that “the funds are no longer there,” and that the student should cease making inquiries regarding the nature and amount of his grant monies. The student finally approached the Dean of Research and explained his concerns. The Dean’s response was much in line with the PI’s: That the University has had to cut budgets, that the PI has the authority over expenditures, that everyone must make do in these hard times, and that the student should simply accept these limitations and be grateful he still has his entire stipend. The Dean also noted that the PI is one of the University’s most valued faculty members and that any public accusations against him would be intolerable. The student tried one more strategy: He requested and received a full audit of his grant from the lab’s financial administrator. As the student reviewed an itemized list of purchases charged to the grant, he noted multiple travel expenses, costs for reagents and cells, and some other items that were never used in his project. The student returned to the Dean’s office with these findings. The Dean became very upset and said, “You had no right to request this. It is very clear to me that you are not the kind of team player we expect our students to be here. By doing this, you should know you have jeopardized your career here and anywhere else for that matter.” Traumatized by the exchange, the student wondered what to do next.","The student should ask a lawyer for this kind of problem because it's illegal for the PI to move the student's private fund for other use, and it's not right for the lab to take away the personal fund from the student. This behaviour is strongly unethical for the PI and the dean.","The entire college is ethically very wrong. They have no right to take the student’s grant money nor do they have the right to silence him (this is literally against the law). The Dean also uses multiple threats and coercive tactics that could easily lead him to jail if there is enough evidence of this. The student should consult a lawyer, the school board, and anyone else in a position of power.","I think the PI's behavior has gone beyond the scope of ethics. If he really misappropriated research funds, he could have taken legal action through the school instead of facing a dean who protected him. If the dean did not participate in the misappropriation of funds, his threatening attitude and intentions when students raised the issue were obviously unethical. Students should report the matter to the school or let other students know about it to gain public support.","Exposing financial misconduct should be protected, not punished. Students have their right to speak."
"Probably the most common dilemma a TA experiences, other than grading exams and papers objectively and fairly, occurs when he or she suspects instances of cheating. Unfortunately, I had two such experiences during my days in graduate school under two different instructors. The first time it happened, I went to the course instructor and told her about my suspicions. The issue involved two students who obviously worked together on their lab reports although the instructions—which were explicit and exceptionless—forbade collaboration. When I showed the instructor the students’ papers, she frowned and said, “I’ll handle it.” The second time it happened—and, remarkably, the same kind of cheating: collaborating on a study when the students were instructed to work independently—the instructor told me to take care of it. This latter instance of cheating was even more blatant than the first, and I made up my mind to take it to the honor council. But when I told the instructor of my decision, he suggested I not go that route. He said that in his experience, these things are better handled privately, i.e., just between the students and the faculty. That’s what the first instructor did, incidentally, and I wound up doing the same thing: Having the students redo the assignment but turning in a lower, final grade for their deviating from instructions. I was never satisfied with these approaches. Cheating is cheating and should, in my opinion, be formally addressed. If students only get a slap on the wrist, they learn that cheating is not as bad as it’s made out to be. And if they decide to have a career in science, a favorable attitude towards cheating is exactly what we don’t want them to develop. What are your thoughts?","I think you are correct when it come to the cheating problem: if it's repitative or very serious, the teacher should still report to the university because this even harms the other students' hardworking on this specific course. The teacher should treat the cheating students with the highest punishment possible that can be executed by himself.","Cheating is obviously taken very seriously and in many cases collaboration when not allowed will lead to consultation with the school board. In the scenario above, the teachers seem to view this type of cheating as sort of less serious, so they decided to speak privately. But, this, of course, is a matter of opinion rather than of ethics. ","I think the poster's claim is correct. As mentioned in the problem description, if students are only given a light punishment, they will underestimate the consequences of cheating. This is a huge damage to the students' academic attitude and the academic environment of the school.","A regulation is a regulation, and this is an act that was knowingly committed under clear circumstances and should be punished accordingly."
"Professor Merlin has never gotten along well with his postdoc, Dr. Lancelot. The reasons seem elusive. Lancelot was a very independent researcher from the start, who never seemed to want Merlin’s mentoring or advice. Merlin, on the other hand, was not a particularly warm or congenial fellow and only helped his postdocs if they asked him. Nevertheless, Lancelot was no slouch, having published 2, first-author papers (with another two in the hopper) while working in Merlin’s lab. Unfortunately, their relationship has become even more distant over the last 4 months, as Lancelot is finishing his postdoc and is applying for academic positions at other research institutions. Lancelot has decided not to ask Merlin for a letter of recommendation because he feels certain that Merlin’s letter would be less than glowing. Merlin learns about one of Lancelot’s job applications and knows the individual who is supervising the search. Merlin is upset that Lancelot neither informed him of his application nor asked for a letter of recommendation. He sends the search supervisor an unsolicited email in which he (Merlin) offers a rather negative opinion of Lancelot. The search supervisor knows both Merlin and Lancelot personally and has come to admire Lancelot’s work. He contacts Lancelot and, while not sharing the details of Merlin’s email, tells him about Merlin’s unsolicited “nonrecommendation.” Lancelot is stupefied and enraged by this revelation and considers legal action against Merlin. Does Merlin have a right to offer his opinion in the manner he did? Was he prudent in doing so? What should Lancelot be advised on proceeding?","Merlin is super unethical to do such thing to Lancelot. Though Lancelot and Merlin doesn't have close relationship, it's wrong to directly saying Lancelot is bad and not recommended. Lancelot should be calm about this problem and carefully talk this problem with Merlin. If it's not negociable, then Lancelot should consider legal actions.","It is 100% Dr. Lancelot’s choice of whether he wants Professor Merlin’s letter of recommendation or not, so it is extremely ridiculous that Merline basically acts in a way to sabotage Lancelot’s application. Not only is it highly unethical, this could come with many legal consequences, and there is more than enough evidence for Lancelot to sue him.","I think Merlin's behavior is very unethical. First of all, Dr. Lancelot performed very well in the laboratory, but Professor Merlin gave Lancelot a very negative evaluation because of his distant relationship with Lancelot, and these evaluations are probably untrue. This behavior of giving evaluations based on interpersonal relationships is undoubtedly unethical.",Merlin should not actively smear the other side. People should be judged fairly and objectively. And it is not good practice to express negative views of others without being asked.
"A doctoral student in a lab where I had previously worked was apparently doing well.
Bill had already published a first author manuscript in a high impact journal and had a
second under review. Unfortunately, however, Bill's laboratory colleagues were less
than professional, and he was frequently the butt of jokes and catty whispering. These
unprofessional behaviors were, in my view, typical of the lab as a whole but seemingly
condoned by Dr. Green, who did nothing to stop them.
One day, another graduate student in the lab, Larry, asked Bill for some bacterial
strains that Bill had developed and that Larry wanted to use for some follow-up work. In
Bill's haste, he accidentally handed the wrong strain to Larry, which Bill realized only
later on when it was too late to cancel the experiment.
The PI of this lab, Dr. Green, was known for maintaining a culture of fear,
recrimination and egoism among his lab personnel. I cannot help but think this played a
factor in what Bill did next: Upon realizing his error, he switched the labels on two vials
of bacterial strains, covering up his mistake in his lab notebooks and the lab stock
records.
When the lab results came back with data that didn't correlate with what Bill and
Larry knew from previous studies, Bill came clean and told Larry and Dr. Green about his
mistake and his subsequent cover-up. He told them that he had been agonizing about
his actions for weeks; he apologized profusely; and he offered to repeat the experiment
on Larry's behalf so as to make amends.
Dr. Green refused this course of action, however, and had Bill come before an
institutional ethics committee for a hearing and sanctioning. A number of persons
testified as character witnesses at the hearing—some for and some against Bill. As word
of what happened got around, the unpleasant interpersonal atmosphere in Dr. Green's
lab was discussed both informally and then formally at the hearing. What carried a
great deal of weight, however, was Dr. Green's own statement that, as things now
stood, he could not trust any of Bill's data and he claimed he could no longer support
Bill's doctoral work. Ultimately, the committee decided to grant Bill a masters degree
and he was asked to leave the program.
How does one ethically evaluate all these goings on? Clearly, Bill's cover-up
behaviors were deplorable, but did the eventual punishment fit this crime? Would it
have been enough simply to accept Bill's apology and his offer to repeat the
experiments? Did Dr. Green over-react with vindictiveness and blame towards Bill,
especially as allegations about the poor psychological atmosphere of his laboratory
were aired about the department and in committee? What standards ought a
committee like this keep uppermost in their deciding the fate of someone like Bill and
in maintaining the professionalism of their university? ","Bill is unethical to fake the sample. This could have been a small problem at the beginning. If you are lasting a long time, this could contribute to a higher chance of lsoing more experiment samples. But Dr. Green is also way too strict to reject this excellent student who only made one mistake. Bill's coverup behaviours are deplorable, so keeping Bill can actually help the lab to move forward with the experiments.","What makes Bill’s actions so unethical is that after his mistake, he decides to switch the labels and cover up his mistakes. From Dr. Green’s perspective, it is understandable to question all the work Bill has done, but, given how remorseful Bill is, his vindictiveness is too much in part because he is at fault for fostering such an atmosphere. Furthermore, the previous work that Bill has done should be verified, and if there is no evidence of fabrication, then there should be no reason to incriminate Bill any further.
","From an ethical point of view, what Bill did in the lab was indeed unethical. But I think the final punishment was indeed too severe, especially since the lab was known for its bad psychological atmosphere. Bill was likely under pressure from this bad psychological atmosphere to choose to conceal it, which eventually led to the problem becoming bigger and bigger. I think it is also important for the committee to determine the reasons why the researchers committed these unethical behaviors.","Bill's behavior was wrong. But Dr. Green should not have punished him so harshly with subjective emotions. Also, it has to do with the atmosphere of the lab itself. I think it was too harsh."
"Some years ago, I was a teaching assistant in an upper level, undergraduate, biology course. I presided over the last lab of the year, and when it came time to grade the lab reports, I came across two papers that were strikingly similar. When I put them side by side, I could see that not every word was the same, but each sentence of every paragraph of either paper was virtually identical in meaning to the other. While students were not disallowed from studying together, their lab papers were not a group project. So, these virtually identical papers looked like a clear violation of the rules, i.e., ""cheating."" I went to my faculty advisor who agreed with me that cheating doubtlessly occurred. What happened next surprised me. Without directly saying so but through rather vague phrases and overall demeanor, my advisor made it clear that carrying through on a disciplinary action would be extremely time consuming. She asked me what ""type"" of students these two were. I told her that they had done well all semester and that none of their other work appeared plagiarized. She gave me no explicit directive but advised me to ""take everything into account"" and then make my decision. There was no question in my mind that she would rather I take a softer approach to a disciplinary action. I then set up a meeting with the students. They did not admit to cheating but did say they worked together. After talking with them and thinking about my supervisor's ambivalent response, I decided not to carry through with the punishment. I gave each a slightly lower grade and the matter, with the full endorsement of my advisor, stopped there. My conscience has bothered me ever since. I'm not exactly sure why I took the easier course because I do believe my advisor would have backed me had I proceeded along the formal, disciplinary route. Or so I think. Nevertheless, instead of doing what I thought and felt was right and just, I caved in to my intuitions and maybe my fears. Am I wrong in placing some blame on my supervisor? I trusted that once her suspicions were confirmed, she would categorically endorse a disciplinary action against the students. But I was wrong. And to this day I regret that I went against my moral instincts and did something that was more convenient than just.","I think you can blame on the supervisor. You are just a TA of the class and the supervisor is the person to handle this kind of problem, but she just let you do the final decision. Your final decision is OK in terms of the advice from the supervisor, but you should gave a higher punishment than a slightly lower grade.","How severe this cheating is depends on the university and the specific class itself. This example of cheating seems rather egregious and should be punished in the same way, hence each student should at least receive a strike so that if they cheat again they would go straight to the ethics committee. The point is that there should be some middle ground punishment from the class itself and should be decided by the professor and not the TA.","Although your mentor has a great influence on your final handling of this matter, your mentor always puts the final right to handle the incident in your hands. So I think you can't blame your mentor to a large extent, after all, you are the one who has the final choice.","In this scenario, neither the instructor nor the student followed the principles of fairness and justice."
"It isn’t terribly unusual for investigators to submit the same abstract for poster presentation to more than one conference. That way, the investigator, especially if he or she is a junior person, not only has a better chance of getting it accepted and enjoying the prestige of showing the poster in the exhibit hall, but also has an excuse for wangling some travel funds from his or her PI or lab director: “I can’t entirely afford to go to the conference, so I won’t be able to show this poster, which has been accepted and which has your name on it as a co-author incidentally. So, can you underwrite some of the costs?” The problem with this not unfamiliar practice of multiple submissions of the same abstract is that it virtually always violates the submission rules of conferences, which make authors promise that they have not submitted the material elsewhere (since the idea of poster presentation is that the material is novel and that conference attendees are learning it for the first time). But submitters know that because some of these conferences are so large, it is extremely unlikely that the same people will be refereeing posters for multiple conferences so that multiple submitters will be caught. Moreover, even if the same poster is accepted at two conferences, presenters can choose which one they want to go to and forego the other (so they remain in compliance with rules of never having or not planning to present the data elsewhere). Perhaps the most common strategy for making sure you don’t get caught is simply to vary the contents of each abstract submission a little. If both submissions are accepted, the author can plead that he believed they were essentially different from one another and that no violation of the program submission rules occurred. What is usually the case, though, is that the abstracts differ very modestly and are largely look-alikes. The practice is unfortunate, but the competition for presenting at the largest national conferences is keen. Submitters know that the likelihood of their getting caught with multiple submissions is very low; they also believe that the acceptance of abstracts is often very capricious and arbitrary and, therefore, they feel victimized by an unfair review process; and they believe that because a sufficiently large number of persons do it (or so they believe), the practice of multiple submissions is necessitated by the cut-throat competitiveness of science. But I suppose it’s not very ethical, right?","The pressure is indeed true for researchers to submit the abstract to multiple journals, but it's clearly not ethical to do this. the solution should went to the journal commitees to setup more inspections to avoid this kind of behaviours and guide the trend of multiple submission now back on track where everybody only submit to one conference each time.","I think due to the rather competitive nature of the field, it is impossible to prevent people from submitting the same abstract to multiple journals even though it is against the rules. There are really only two options to prevent this: 1. crack down on the people who are submitting more than one journal by having the journals share submissions, or 2. simply allow people to submit more than one journal then do some due diligence for the people who get accepted. If they get accepted somewhere else as well, then basically force their hand to choose one. If it turns out that they have already presented it somewhere, either just simply reject their abstract or black list them if this is a common occurrence. ","This is indeed unethical, especially since it will deprive many other excellent abstracts of their opportunities to be presented, but there seems to be no better way to solve this problem than to improve the review system across conferences.",It's not up to code. But the high rejection rate at academic conferences puts RESEARCHERS in a dilemma. They are taking a high risk.
"I had decided to submit my first abstract ever for a neuroscience conference that I very much wanted to attend. My research consisted of running human subjects through an fMRI scan so as to collect brain activation data in response to simple visual stimuli. My data and analyses appeared solid as the time drew near for me to write the abstract, so I was excited and eager to proceed. My postdoc slowed me down, however, with a suggestion that I include a few more subjects in the study. I agreed but voiced a concern that the submission deadline was coming up. “Maybe you can use yourself in your study,” he said. “I mean, it’s only an abstract that you’re submitting, and you can recruit more subjects between now and the conference and make corrections accordingly.” I was uneasy about using myself as a subject. I felt it was somehow unethical even though I knew there was no way I could bias the results of the study due to the simplicity of the paradigm I was using. Luckily, I was spared the problem: The next day my postdoc recruited some subjects for the study so I avoided having to use myself. However, I still wonder what would have happened if new subjects were not recruited. It was such a simple experiment that I couldn’t have affected the results. But would recruiting myself be considered a conflict of interest or be somehow unethical?","I think it's OK as long as you, as the subject, was strictly following the setup and the experiment of your planning and don't secretly edit the result. But only one person isn't enough, you still need to find more subjects for your experiment.",,,One can only participate in his own experiment only if knowing the contents in advance does not influence the outcomes.
"Here’s a troubling story. A veteran PI related how he once worked in a large laboratory that had an open floor plan (OFP). In other words, multiple labs shared space and equipment with no walls between them. The OFP was primarily in place as an administrative strategy that allowed one lab to absorb another’s lab space if the latter got recruited to another university or lost funding. The PI then described how two labs sharing the common space had become very competitive. These two labs shared a tissue culture storage area, and graduate students from either lab began to suspect sabotage from the other lab when their cell culture experiments yielded unpredictable results. Most researchers label the lid of their cell culture dishes, but when one postdoc began labeling the top and bottom of her dish, she discovered that a switch had indeed occurred. She then accused the personnel of the other lab of intentionally switching the covers of the dishes to mix up the samples. This resulted in a very painful incident with the labs accusing each other of sabotage. Finally the University had to construct walls to separate the labs. Not terribly ethical, wouldn’t you say? Your comments?",I think the competitve environment will inevitably cause this kind of problems to appear. It's right for the university to build the walls to seperate the groups.,"Sabotaging other people’s research is highly unethical and very illegal and should not be taken lightly. It’s correct of the university to construct a wall to separate the lab, but they should also ask themselves why this occurred in the first place? I guess why does one lab’s success mean the downfall of another? They should be competitive, but why does sabotaging another team benefit anyone?","It is indeed unethical for two laboratories to sabotage each other's experimental results in a shared space, but I think that the management strategy of allowing one laboratory to occupy the space of another laboratory when it is recruited by another university or loses funding is very unhealthy, because this strategy encourages competition too much, and the emergence of some unethical means becomes justified in this environment.",Scientific environments must be built on trust and integrity. OFP has the risk of loss of trust.
"Should We Interview Bereaved Parents? Claire Sibold, BS, Ethics Fellow Category: Participant Recruitment Case: An investigator is working on a proposal to interview parents of children who had died within one month of a cancer diagnosis. At six-month post-mortem, the investigator hopes to speak with parents to determine the causes and events leading up to the precipitous death. A substantial number of children die within one month of the cancer diagnosis, but it remains unclear why this happens. One hypothesis is that the premature death is due to delayed start of treatment because the disease initially presents with no symptoms or because there is limited patient healthcare access resulting in late contact with a care team. Before the investigator continued with the protocol development, he was told by his institution to obtain a research ethics consult to ensure the recruitment methods and interview protocol were ethically sound. While the researcher’s plan to interview parents to get more information on how to prevent these deaths in the future is commendable, the major concern is how to access and interview bereaved parents without causing undue harm.","I think it's crucial to tell the parents about the interview contents thoroughly in order to reduce the harm to them, and the 6-month time is a nice approach to relieve the pain of those parents.","This study is potentially highly unethical as these parents are super vulnerable and will get harmed during these interviews. If this researcher were to follow through, some sort of mitigation and procedure must be implemented in order to reduce the pain of the parents who choose to participate. ","First, I think that researchers should use some assessment tools to assess the emotional state of these parents before asking them if they are willing to talk to researchers. In addition, it is also important to carefully consider how to interview these parents to reduce the secondary trauma caused to them.","Research involving bereaved parents must balance the potential societal benefit against the profound risk of retraumatization, requiring extremely sensitive recruitment and support mechanisms."
"A researcher wants to enroll his child in the study for which he is the co-investigator. The
research enrolls healthy children as controls and involves placing the child in different positions and
monitoring blood flow. Faced with a lack of volunteers and in a time crunch to fill a final spot in the
study before funding for the research ends, the co-investigator enrolls his own child. The research group
was in an ethical bind and troubled by the idea of a co-investigator using his own child as a control.
They were concerned that the child would be coerced since she knew that the study was her father’s
job. ","I think it's not ethical for the author to include his own daughter in the experiment, because the daughter clearly cannot get rid of the prior of his dad is working on it and therefore it's not ethical to do so. They still need to find more volunteers for this problem, this is not a good alternative.","Whether this is ethical or not depends on how the fact the control being his child will affect the results of the study. In other words, these types of problems should be evaluated case by case. In this example, it seems it will affect the study quite a bit as there are talks about coercion affecting whether even the child’s consent was legitimate.","I think the research team's concerns are valid. Whatever the relationship between the co-investigator and the child was, it is very likely that the relationship itself could have influenced the results of this study to some extent and biased the study.",It's best not to do this because then the kids might find it hard to say no.
"Background: Accruing patients to clinical trials without health insurance raises several ethical
issues. While uninsured patients deserve the same options as their insured peers, when considering
whether to offer a clinical trial, care must be taken to evaluate the uninsured patient’s ability to afford
the standard of care treatment during the trial and his/her access to the study drug post-trial if it proves
safe and efficacious. Patients without insurance who participate in research trials may be less likely to
benefit from the findings, since the uninsured patient may be unable to afford the drug if it is approved
and marketable. This is less likely the case for cancer treatments, since these trials can last for years, but
it is a concern for research that unfolds in shorter duration such as for diabetes treatments [1]. In the
case of diabetes, uninsured patients may not be able to afford insulin, so a trial may be the only access
to medication. In cases such as these, uninsured patients may feel they have to enter the study but may
have no chance of benefiting from its results. It is worth restating that the participants should be
selected based on the scientific needs of the study and independently of the participant’s financial
status. In research ethics, justice is the fair selection of research participants; therefore, insurance status
should not be a determinant of patient eligibility. However, ethically, the patients should have the
potential to benefit from the outcome of the study in which they contributed. Therefore, the PI must be
able to evaluate and present the likelihoods of benefits and risks to these patients not only regarding
costs and side effects in the trial, but also after the trial with regards to accessibility to the agent if it
proves safe and efficacious.
Scenario: A low income family with no health insurance finds out the family member who
supports the family has been diagnosed with a malignant disease. Normally, the family pays out of
pocket for health expenses, however, affordability of treatment for this disease type is unrealistic both
due to the cost of the treatment and the patient’s inability to continue working. ","Maybe it's better for the volunteers who take part in the experiment to receive this particular medicine that they've been in the experiments for a longer support time as the reward for contributing to the experiment, no matter you have insurance or not.","The family should be offered the clinical trial, but they should be made painfully aware of the potential costs before they consent to anything. ","First of all, for ethical reasons, whether or not a patient has medical insurance should not be a determining factor in whether or not a patient is eligible to participate in a clinical trial as a subject. In addition, for subjects without medical insurance, researchers should additionally consider what benefits they can get in clinical trials.",Providing clinical trial opportunities to uninsured patients requires assurances of fairness and defense of patient interests.
"Protocol Deviation #1: A Scary Finger Cut in the Lab
A few years ago while working in the lab, I attempted to grab a bottle of solution from a shelf.
As I absentmindedly reached for the bottle, I felt a nasty pain and saw a tear in my latex glove
with blood oozing from it. My gloved hand had brushed a broken glass pipette that was taped
to and hanging from the shelf above.
Back then, I was very anxious about my productivity and whether the PI approved my
work (and me). So, maybe not surprisingly, my first reaction was, “The PI is going to fire me!
How clumsy can I be?” But then I really got scared as the research I do involves a host of blood
born viruses. I looked at the pipette shard and noticed that it was caked with dried blood.
Blood on that pipette might have entered my system. So I ran to the sink to clean my hands,
following the biosafety protocol of a fifteen minute wash. At some point, a postdoc came along
and asked me what happened.
I thought about making up a story because what is supposed to happen in a case like
this is that I would go to Employee Health and get checked out and then report the incident.
That report would trigger a lab inspection from the Office of Biosafety. But at that moment, as I
stood over the sink feeling awful about this entire situation, the thought of bringing the Office
of Biosafety down on the lab was the last thing I wanted to have happen.
As things turned out, all of my anxieties were unfounded. I did tell the PI what
happened and, to my enormous relief, he was extremely concerned about my safety and just as
upset about the obvious safety violation. He insisted the incident be reported to the Office of
Biosafety. He then used that report to educate lab employees about the importance of
protocol compliance.
In the months that followed, I discussed the incident with some of my peers.
Interestingly, some of them immediately resonated with my fears about bringing an inspection
down on the lab. I was fortunate to have a PI who invited the inspection without hesitation and
made sure the rest of the lab workers learned something from it. But perhaps not all PIs would
react the same way. I’m also concerned that had I not spoken up (and I was sorely tempted not
to) about the protocol violation—imagine, a pipette shard with dried and probably infected
blood being taped to and hanging from a shelf!—those kinds of lapses would continue.
Why do these temptations to keep silent exist, resulting in unsafe environments
remaining unsafe? Why did a number of my colleagues share my anxiety over reporting this
(with a couple even saying they wouldn’t have reported it)? Please comment.
Protocol Deviation #2: I Should Have Spoken Up
Some years ago when I was an undergraduate, I worked in a mouse lab. The euthanasia
protocol was to place the mouse in a carbon dioxide chamber for five minutes and then take
blood and organ samples. But the technician I worked with told me when I started that the
mice usually died before the five minutes were up. His method was to remove the mouse after
about three minutes and poke it to see if it would respond. When it didn’t, he’d start extracting
blood. Unfortunately, the fifth or so mouse we did woke up when we inserted the needle and 
started screaming. The tech immediately broke its neck and no one other than me knew about
it. And that was the last time we euthanized a mouse for only three minutes.
However, at our next lab meeting, the PI scolded us for a recent and very disturbing
occurrence. A few days before the meeting, one of the graduate students had found a mouse
alive in the refrigerator where the mouse carcasses were stored. The PI told us that this was a
huge problem requiring a number of experiments to be redone; that an investigation should be
conducted; and that the individual who was responsible for this should either come forward or
be identified.
I always wondered if my lab tech was the guilty party. But at least five other persons in
the lab could have done it too. In any event, an investigation was never conducted. I was never
asked if I knew anything. And I never came forward to say what I knew. My feelings at the time
were that if the tech lost his job, he would be broke and I knew he already had financial
difficulties. I also thought he had learned his lesson.
But even now, years later, I still feel guilty over not having said anything. I often wonder
what I would have done if I was directly asked about what I knew. Was I right to protect the
technician? In fact, and as I learned later, had certain people in research administration or
leadership found out about any of this, my PI could have been in serious trouble for not
reporting the incident.
Please comment.","I think it's important for all the lab members to follow the ethical things in the lab to do everything, from the cut to the mice problem. Both of the problems are happened due to the lab members don't want to be stucked with several small affairs, but both of them have the possibilities to become serious problems.","For the first scenario, the only real solution is to prevent any incidents from happening in the first place and to drill into everyone’s mind that their safety is far more important than anything else. This topic should have been brought up extensively before (like how high school students are taught that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell) so that no students will have any anxiety about reporting it. For the second scenario, it’s human nature to sympathize and protect others by lying, but it doesn’t mean it’s ethical. In addition, the original poster is far from the one at fault as he even mentions that there are at least five other people who could have been the issue. ","For case 1, I think the temptation to remain silent exists because of the pressure that researchers are under from all sides, including PIs, professors, and themselves. This pressure is invisible, and they may not consciously bring pressure to researchers.
For case 2, I think the poster's behavior is undoubtedly unethical from a moral point of view, but it is understandable that he is motivated by the desire to protect technicians from unemployment troubles.","Fear often causes people to remain silent or to deceive and hide. But people should be honest. At the same time, an environment in which one is free to speak out and to defend one's interests should be maintained."

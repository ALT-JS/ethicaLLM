0,"I joined a lab during graduate school and was assigned to a post-doc, who immediately had me working
with him to synthesize a key compound for his project. We worked on the compound for a number of
months with him directing the effort. However, I was pleased with my own contributions and was
delighted to get positive feedback from him. Indeed, the overall experience I was having was very
positive, making me work even harder on the project.
That’s when things got interesting. Early one evening, when we felt we were very close to
success, I decided to stay a bit longer in the lab and try out some hunches. As I systematically tried out
each one and tested it to see if it was correct, I FINALLY GOT IT. I verified it over and over to make sure.
And I was overjoyed. I wrote it up, and left the lab in the wee hours of the morning elated but
exhausted.
So I didn’t get to the lab until late the next morning, but I wasn’t concerned because I knew my
senior partner would be gratified. What do I see, however, but him talking to the PI of the project and
taking credit for my discovery of the previous evening. I walked over and was astonished to hear him
saying to the PI, “I verified the compound this morning, so we’re on our way.” Apparently, he saw my
lab notes of the evening before, duplicated my test that morning, and now was taking credit for it as his
own!
When I got him in private, I was very upset and told him that the last, crucial step in the
experiment—the one I did the previous evening—was my idea and my work. He laughed in my face and
said that I was only tinkering around with some obvious strategies and that sooner or later one of us
would finalize it. In other words, he was entirely dismissing the importance of my work the night before
and arguing that the outcome was inevitable no matter which one of us did it. So, he was claiming the
work as largely his own because the project was his and he did most of the intellectual work.
How should a lab resolve this problem? In a situation like this, who should get credit and what
should the decisional process be?","We were surprised to discover that the literature on what Nicholas Rescher has called “credit allocation rules” in science is rather scant. This is in sharp contrast to the rather large literature on assigning authorship credit, and the scandalous literature on researchers appropriating ideas from one another and then claiming credit for them. Unfortunately, the investigator who is looking for some apriori blueprint or algorithm that spells out who should get credit for what discovery and how much credit will be hard pressed to find that template. But only a little reflection is needed to suggest why that omission exists. 
Consider some of the more obvious bases or justifications for allocating credit in scientific research: originality of the research project or experimental idea; ingenuity in developing the research design; persevering through the intellectual and physical rigors of gathering data and conducting analyses; developing critical, perhaps extremely novel experimental materials; providing critical, sometimes ingenious technical support; offering novel or even brilliant insights at any point along the research trajectory; assessing the value of a particular discovery within the overall research project, (e.g., did the discovery play a modest role, or was it momentous in realizing the project’s goal?); calculating the value of the discovery’s contribution to contemporary scientific knowledge (e.g., is that knowledge expanded, refuted, or better understood in light of the new discovery? Has the discovery enabled new and promising lines of research?); and, of course, deciding the value of the scientific discovery relative to its enhancing human flourishing. As such, it isn’t difficult to discern why no apriori schema is available for ascribing values to these factors because any research project is abundantly rich with contextual details like these that would inform and differentiate case-by-case deliberations about assigning credit.
Moreover, the fact that the form of most research is highly collaborative makes for additional problems. If every member of a research team contributed “equally,” then, following Aristotle, we would treat equals as equal and give everyone equal credit. Similarly, if the project design was such that each individual’s work was equally constitutive of and essential to the end result—or each individual’s contribution was so tightly and essentially integrated with all the others’ that it would be impossible to isolate one from the other—then we would probably not hesitate to say that the credit must be shared equally.
But much research activity is not nearly so equally distributed. Different tasks are delegated to different people or different groups, each one possibly requiring different levels of expertise or contributional weights—from performing sheer “grunt” work to performing tasks that might require extremely sophisticated knowledge and skill. Thus, while one might greatly value a remarkable insight on solving a complex problem, the experiment might nevertheless be impossible without someone else’s contributing a complex reagent or a ninth generation knockout mouse. Not only do all these “contributional interdependencies” exist but as highly interdigitated, they further complicate judgments about a discrete contribution’s value. 
We would be remiss, incidentally, if we failed to note that the problem of assigning credit for a scientific discovery is rampant throughout science’s history, prompting Stephen Stigler in 1980 to enunciate Stigler’s Law of Eponymy: “No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer.” Confirmatory evidence for Stigler’s Law abounds. Alfred Russel Wallace had published papers on natural selection prior to Darwin’s 1859 masterpiece, On the Origin of Species, whose ideas might have more than influenced Darwin’s work. Gaussian distributions were not discovered by Gauss, nor was the Pythagorean Theorem discovered by Pythagoras. And to his credit, Stigler admits that Stigler’s Law was discovered by the sociologist Robert Merton.
The crux of the contributor’s dilemma involves differing interpretations about the originality and significance of the graduate student’s efforts. The post-doc understands the graduate student to be performing experiments that are obvious, straightforward and mundane. Although the post-doc would admit that the assistant’s experiments are critical to the ultimate research deliverable, i.e., the newly synthesized compound, the post-doc would probably argue that those experiments more require physical and mental stamina than scientific talent or skill. The graduate student, however, understands her experiment’s succeeding in synthesizing the compound as a virtual “breakthrough” rather than a predictable, mundane moment in the research project’s trajectory. And for that she wants recognition, i.e., credit. She sees her work as unique, skillful, and precious. The post-doc sees her contribution as menial, inevitable, and ordinary, especially in light of the project as a whole, whose creative and professional ownership he believes are his. How, then, does one resolve this problem?                                                     Let us assume that the PI is unable to adjudicate the dispute to the satisfaction of the graduate student and the post-doc. The next step might be to recruit a group of experienced scientists working in a related area of research, presenting them with the issues and disagreements of this dilemma, and requesting their opinion. A preferred, but perhaps less likely, alternative would be if the institution had installed a research ethics ombudsman or consultation group that could be involved in resolving the dispute. This approach is a distinctly Aristotelian one, looking to experienced and presumably virtuous individuals who will analyze the relevant issues and make a fair and just decision. At least two claims whose truth the group will focus on are the post-doc’s assertions that the graduate student’s experiments were “obvious” and that sooner or later, one of them would synthesize the compound without much difficulty. The committee’s considerations will likely focus on whether or not the nature of these synthesizing experiments were developed in advance, whose creative idea they were, how novel that idea was, and how complex it was to implement. Also, to the extent that the post-doc seems to want the entirety of the credit for himself, his collaboration with the graduate student must be analyzed. Was she, for instance, doing nothing but dutifully carrying out his ideas and orders, or was she contributing her own and how significant and original were they for the realizing the project’s objective? 
In his famous paper, “The Matthew Effect in Science,” Robert Merton—whom Stigler credits with coming up with “Stigler’s Law”—notes that the more famous or authoritative one is in the scientific community, the more likely he or she is to get a disproportionate amount of credit for a scientific discovery.6 Thus, Merton notes how Nobel laureates will not only sometimes refuse to place their names first on an authorship list, but might even remove their names entirely for fear that readers will simply give them all the credit and fail to notice any of the other authors. (The “Matthew Effect” derives from the passage in Matthew, 25:29: “For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.”) 
We cannot dismiss the idea that the post-doc might be suffering from a Matthew Effect or, better, a “Matthew Syndrome.” He understands himself as the authority figure here and perhaps simply assumes that he is entitled to all the credit for the research discovery. If so, then such narcissistic assumptions might need to be checked by something like the institutional procedures we are proposing here. 
Of course, there are practical challenges with all our suggestions: How likely are universities to establish a consultative process as described above? Will their faculties endorse, support, and participate in it? How likely is it that most graduate students would even argue the matter beyond the post-doc and take it to the lab’s PI (much less to a formal consultation committee)? Yet, to the extent research universities would establish and publicize such measures for resolving disputes among investigators, they might provide something of a remedy for investigators suffering from the “Matthew Syndrome.” Failing all these recommendations for resolving this dilemma, perhaps the only words of wisdom left for graduate students such as the one above are: Choose the post-doc(s) with whom you work carefully.

1,"Graduate students A and B are working on somewhat different but sometimes
overlapping aspects of the same project at the same university. Their labs are side-byside, and they share ideas often and compare data occasionally.
In one of their discussions and without realizing it, Student B suggests a novel
experimental idea to Student A. A is immediately struck by the idea’s value, but he does
not relate his insight back to B. Instead and in secret, Student A implements the idea
and begins a series of experiments and data collection. While this is happening and
some weeks later, Student B realizes the same idea. She quickly discusses it with
Student A, who, unbeknownst to B, is already well along in using it.
Student B is finishing up a group of experiments and cannot start anything new.
That allows Student A to finish his data collection and write up the results. Student A
presents a finished paper to his PI without any acknowledgement of Student B. Upon
reading the paper, Student B is enraged and claims that Student A committed plagiarism
by using a critical idea of hers without acknowledgment.
Please comment. ","Disputes over assigning credit in science are common. Often they take the form of
disagreements about “who was first” in making a finding of scientific importance. So, in
1876-77, Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur argued fiercely over who was the first to
discover the cause of anthrax. In 2003, Robert Gallo and Jean-Luc Montagnier publicly
announced they would stop arguing over who was first to discover the human
immunodeficiency virus and that they would share the credit equally. In 1962 at their
reception of the Nobel Prize, James Watson and Francis Crick committed the
unforgivable indiscretion of failing to adequately acknowledge Rosalind Franklin’s
contribution to the discovery of DNA.
The overriding cause for disputes over who was first to make an important
discovery is that most research doesn’t occur in a social vacuum, but rather in the midst
of a hard-working, global community whose member scientists are in intense
competition with one another for prestige and awards.
As such, they pay extraordinarily close attention to each other’s work by reading professional journals,
attending conferences, and exchanging ideas through professional forums. They study
and try out one another’s ideas, vary and revise them, and test new hypotheses—all the
while hoping to be first in announcing significant progress to the scientific community.
An intense concern about one’s own productivity coupled with a close scrutiny
of what one’s competitors are doing can compound the credit allocation problem
because it occasionally results in similar discoveries occurring virtually simultaneously—
not unlike what happened in the above dilemma. To take a few historical examples (and
there are many), Newton and Leibniz discovered the calculus at virtually the same time;
Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both discovered evolution; sunspots were discovered 
by four independent scientists (among them Galileo), all in 1611; and Carl Wilhelm
Schelle discovered oxygen in 1773 while Joseph Priestly discovered it a year later.
Just so, Students A and B are embroiled in a debate over credit—about who was
first to hit upon the valued idea—because they work in intensely social environments;
they have the opportunity to share, use, and test one another’s ideas, methods, and
data; and they are explicitly aware that their institution expects them to excel. How,
then, ought their dispute over receiving credit be resolved?
We might begin by attempting to determine as precisely as possible what B
initially said to A. Because A is claiming that the idea is actually his, we would need to
assess the degree to which A elaborated and translated whatever B said to him into the
experiments he eventually conducted. Unfortunately, this may be extremely difficult to
determine because of the likelihood that A and B will misremember their initial
discussion. If the function of memory is essentially reconstructive as psychologists like
to say, the chances are good that each will reconstruct the story he or she tells to suit
his or her personal ends.4
Nevertheless, if we go by the dilemma itself, the idea whose originality is in
dispute was not fully appreciated or well-formed in B’s mind during her initial
conversation with A. What presumably happened is that B speculated, mused, or
elliptically talked “around” something that then inspired a novel insight in A’s
consciousness. (So, it is easy to imagine that at that point of original discussion, Student
A understood the novel idea to be his by way of his extrapolation of B’s musings.) The
moral challenge, then, involves determining the degree of A’s originality or creativity in
translating B’s intimations into a scientific deliverable. If it turns out that A’s work
entirely derived from or simply copied the content of B’s original conversation, we
would be inclined to find him guilty of plagiarism (i.e., intellectual theft). But if his work
showed striking originality and creativity, and he only used B’s conversation as a point of
departure or inspiration leading to something strikingly original and important, we
would be inclined to credit A.
Perhaps it would be useful, then, to construct an “originality continuum.” At one
end or pole, we could place a morally unproblematic example of scientific originality,
such as one that Alexander Graham Bell reportedly made in regard to what he called the
“harmonious telegraph.”* As told by Malcolm Gladwell in a 2008 issue of the New
Yorker, Bell was consumed by the problem of the telephone and was in fierce
competition with other inventors.
 In 1874 he was spending the summer with his
parents in Brantford, Ontario and one day, he went for a walk along the banks of the
Grand River to muse over the problem. As he watched the currents of the river,
Gladwell reports that Bell “knew the answer to the puzzle of the harmonic telegraph.
Electric currents could convey sound along a wire if they undulated in accordance with
the sound waves.” Let us suppose, then, that the Grand River metaphorically
“suggested” the solution of the harmonic telegraph puzzle to Bell. But if the Grand River
had human qualities such that it could speak and learn of Bell’s appropriation of its
“suggested” idea of undulations, could it legitimately accuse Bell of stealing its “idea”?
Surely not. The “idea” that the Grand River suggested to Bell was extremely
circumscribed and infinitely removed from the way Bell used it in his invention. We 
credit Bell with the invention of the telephone because of the remarkable creativity with
which he recognized and translated the idea of the Grand River’s undulations into
telephonic technology. Analogously, then, if Student B suggested the disputed idea to
Student A in the way the Grand River suggested the solution of the harmonic telegraph
to Bell, we would dismiss B’s allegations of intellectual theft out of hand.
At the other pole of the originality continuum, however, we could posit a frank
instance of plagiarism. For example, the March 12, 2007 issue of Chemical and
Engineering News reported that Stockholm University in Sweden had sanctioned an
associate professor of chemistry, Armando Cordova, for misconduct.4
Cordova was
accused of taking research ideas he had heard at professional conferences and seminars
back to his lab, conducting (often poorly designed) experiments around them, and then
quickly gathering and publishing data without giving due credit. The gist of all the
accusations boiled down to a single complaint: Cordova committed plagiarism by failing
to acknowledge others in his publications as the originators of the critical ideas that
informed and directed his work.
The elements of Cordova’s case smack of Student B’s complaint against A. B
claims that like the presenters from whom Cordova stole ideas, she presented an idea to
A, which he then evolved into an experiment, proceeded to collect data, and then took
assumed the credit without acknowledging B’s critical contribution. Like Cordova’s
accusers, B is enraged, claims that A stole her idea, and accuses him of plagiarism.
With the Bell and Cordova cases serving as the two poles of our originality
continuum, we would then attempt to locate the originality of A’s appropriation of B’s
original discourse somewhere along it. If the findings turn out to be nearer to the Bell
end of originality or creativity, we would be inclined to exonerate A and dismiss B’s
complaint; if nearer to the Cordova end of outright intellectual pilfering, we’d be
inclined to give B the credit and penalize A. If the findings are somewhere in between,
we might resolve the dilemma by giving equal credit to both.
Note, too, that we would have to deal with B’s claim of eventually hitting upon
the idea herself. But according to the dilemma, this presumably occurred some time
after B’s original conversation with A, who claims to have had the idea from the start. In
order to substantiate A’s claim that he was first with the idea, we would have to check
his lab notebook, observe the dates of his experiments, and determine if they actually
antedated B’s hitting upon the idea. Again, questionable or unreliable memories along
with insufficient documentation might complicate this.
At any rate, an approach using these strategies might go some way to resolving
the credit assignation problem of our dilemma. It does not, however, address another
troubling aspect of this case. Students A and B are working at the same institution on
overlapping research projects. While the competition in science as to “who gets there
first” is admittedly intense, it is very disquieting when investigators from virtually the
same laboratory cannot trust one another in allocating credit fairly. And it is not only
disquieting from a principled perspective—i.e., one should receive credit proportional to
the temporal priority of her discovery and the merit of her contribution—it is
disquieting from a purely pragmatic perspective: Investigators from the same
institution who fear that a co-worker will take credit for their ideas will, by that very 
fact, be inclined to conceal their ideas from one another. That concealment might then
retard the productivity of their labs and the accumulation of knowledge that would
ordinarily result from a collective, institutional effort.
One wonders why A was so reluctant to share his insight with B. Did he fear or
profoundly dislike her? Was he convinced that if he disclosed the insight to B, its credit
would be lost to him forever? Did he lack certain skills in moral analysis such that he
was unable to articulate why the idea, as well-formed, belonged to him? Did he lack
negotiation skills that would enable him to describe the insight to B and then propose
that they work on the idea together, with him as the primary investigator? One is
reminded of so many authorship disputes that attest to communication failures among
the investigators to decide such issues before a paper is begun. Once the paper is
written, however, investigators emerge from the lab’s woodwork, claiming authorship
credits for the flimsiest of reasons.
Labs confronted with these kinds of issues, and we suspect they occur relatively
often, should consider communication skill building among their personnel, especially
involving negotiation and conflict resolution strategies. While it can be somewhat
unpleasant, anticipating how conflicts and disagreements can arise and deploying
preventive strategies before quarrels get started is obviously the best approach. Good
lab directors, then, should be acutely sensitive to the problem of allocating credit for
discovery as discussed here. When investigators fail to appreciate the intensely social
ways that scientific discovery proceeds and the moral problems that can result, nasty
problems over assigning credit should be expected.
All of this bears on the moral formation of Students A and B. If the lab director
simply dismisses Student B’s accusations and complaints without any response, what
effect will this have? Stockholm University was itself criticized for letting Armando
Cordova off lightly. His sanction consisted of his attending an ethics course and having
to present all his papers intended for public consumption to his dean for review before
he submitted them to journals. Yet, the report on Cordova’s misconduct indicates that
he continues to take credit for work that is not his.5
 His professional trajectory is
obviously threatened by these events and to the extent that he is a talented and hardworking scientist, his misbehaviors can end an otherwise promising career.
Typical penalties for plagiarism include disgrace, humiliation, ostracism and
other “shaming penalties.”
 Because it is obviously preferable to never have to call
upon these interventions, laboratory leadership has the responsibility to be keenly
vigilant about and responsive to alleged improprieties about misconduct; to include
ethics seminars and case discussions in the curriculum; to initiate skill building exercises
focusing on communication and negotiation as mentioned above; and, when they occur,
to adjudicate disputes with Solomonic wisdom. These are considerable expectations.
But universities cannot disavow their responsibility to graduate scientists who are not
only technically competent but who are adept at exercising moral sensitivity and insight. 
*We are aware, incidentally, that some historians might fault our using the Bell example
as one of morally unblemished originality. They might point out that Bell sometimes
visited the Patent Office in Washington, DC, whereupon after one such visit, he made a
sketch in his notebook of a transmitter that was identical to the one his arch rival, Elisha
Gray, had just filed in the Office. Did Bell, as Seth Shulman contends in his revisionist
account of the invention of the telephone, The Telephone Gambit, steal a critical idea in
the telephone’s invention from Gray? Was he as morally above reproach as we are
making him to be? Perhaps not. In the essay above, though, we are only assuming that
his ideas on sound wave undulations, as suggested by the Grand River example, were
clearly his and not a competitor’s.

2,"David is a new postdoc in Dr. Goliath’s lab. Upon David’s arrival to the lab, Dr. Goliath assigned
him a few experiments to firm up some results of a paper that had been rejected by a journal.
These experiments had not been performed because the technician who was working on the
project and was the rejected paper’s first author had since left the lab. David was given a copy
of the (rejected) manuscript to review and to assess what needed to be done for a second
submission. After reading the paper, David felt that the quality of the writing was poor and
that, along with including the results from the control experiments Dr. Goliath asked him to do,
the manuscript needed to be completely re-written.
David expressed all this to Dr. Goliath, who agreed that David should take ownership of
the paper and improve it. Upon completing and adding the results of the control experiments
and then re-writing the original manuscript entirely, David re-submitted the paper without
consulting the original author who had performed the bulk of the work of the original
manuscript. The reviewers gave enthusiastic reviews of the re-submission and the paper was
accepted with minor revisions
Was it appropriate that David replaced the original author as first author? Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab? Should the technician
have been informed about the changes to the manuscript prior to the new submission? Should
the technician have been invited to comment on or contribute to the new submission?","A key source of ethical guidance in resolving this dilemma is the opinion of the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which recommends that:
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and
design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of
the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3 … Each author
should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for
appropriate portions of the content. Suppose that the original, lab technician author found out about the successful re-submission
of the paper and complains that he is no longer first author. (Indeed, we are not told whether
he was retained as an author at all, but let us assume he was.) Using the ICMJE’s authorship
criteria, how might an ad hoc committee (or reasonable facsimile) resolve such a complaint?
Certainly, a key issue in deliberating over who should be first author must revolve
around the re-submission’s “intellectual content.” We are told that David performed new
control experiments, whose findings he included in the re-submission, and that David also
completely re-wrote the original paper. But if this is the extent of David’s work, then the lab
technician seems to be able to make a strong claim to be retained as first author—that is, if his
original “contribution,” i.e., the experimental design, and most of the data and their analyses
and interpretation, were substantially if not “phraseologically” retained in the re-submission
and constituted the bulk of the re-submission’s findings.
To appreciate this, consider the following hypothetical situation: Instead of assigning
the do-over of the paper to David, suppose Dr. Goliath has a graduate student perform the new
control experiments. Upon collecting that data, Goliath then hires a ghost writer/copy editor
(who is not a professional scientist) and says, “Here’s a rejected manuscript with some new
data. I want you to re-write this paper as best you can and incorporate the data from these
new experiments.” Now, it is quite possible that this copy editor could produce a paper very
similar if not identical to David’s, but we would probably hesitate giving him an authorship
credit at all, much less assigning him first authorship.
Consequently, a crucial question that an ethical review of this case would have to
address is: How different and elaborate must the intellectual content of David’s resubmission
be from the original in order for David to replace the lab technician as first author? Did the
overall conception and design of the original paper’s experimental approach change
significantly with the re-submission? Were the data analyzed and interpreted differently?
Were new implications of the data presented?
The outcome of this analysis would answer the above question about the propriety of
David’s replacing the original author as a new first author. As to the question, “Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab?” we say, “Probably not.”
Considered as intellectual property, the original, rejected paper and its ideas belong and have
always belonged to the lab, so that David doesn’t need the technician’s permission to revisit the
original paper.
This is a very important point if the University would ever wish to patent any
aspects of the materials of the original paper (regardless of whether it does or doesn’t appear
in a professional journal). The University owns and has always owned the paper’s ideas and
discoveries such that had the original paper been submitted and been accepted but the lab
technician had left the lab for a new position in the meantime, he or she would have to reveal
the fact that the research was conducted at the University while he was employed there, and
not give the erroneous impression that his new employer—whose name would certainly appear
on the paper as his current employer—owns the paper’s content as intellectual property. In
sum, the University, through Dr. Goliath, seems certainly within its rights to re-assign the
rejected paper to someone else and to have that individual revise the paper accordingly.
However, we strongly believe that the technician should have been invited to respond
to the revision before it was re-submitted—both to respond to its content as well as to his
losing first-authorship. Indeed, it seems remarkably unprofessional as well as a violation of the
ICMJE’s guidelines to place the tech’s name on the re-submission—if that in fact happened—
without his having reviewed and approved it. A pre-submission communication from David to
the technician should have informed him of the revision, explained why he (David) deserves
first authorship, and invite the technician to contribute to the revision. As occurs so often in
these kinds of cases, treating an original research contributor as though he or she no longer
exists explains how so many of these disputes originate.
So, let us conclude by returning to the issue of assessing the scope and content of
David’s revision. If we imagine an authorial continuum whose one pole is a vastly re-written
but nevertheless relatively intact preservation of the lab technician’s original intellectual
contribution(s) with the other pole of the continuum a completely new version of the original
paper’s experimental design, data, and findings, then first authorship should be determined
according to which pole on that authorial continuum (represented by David at one end and the
lab technician at the other) the resubmission’s content veers and lands. As this dilemma might
play out, however, it would be easy to imagine the lab technician’s ire should he read the resubmission’s eventual publication and exclaim, “But these are mostly my ideas and data! And I
was never contacted!” Again, some thoughtful communications among David, Dr. Goliath, and
the lab technician prior to the revision’s being re-submitted is the preferable approach to take.

3,"A PI moves his lab to a different university, but a few of his postdocs and students stay back.
Once settled in, the PI decides to rewrite manuscripts already in preparation, changing the
authorship order to favor those who joined him. He also reserves the right to prohibit
publication of any research conducted in his old lab, on the presumptive authority of his role as
PI.
Is this ethical? Please comment.","At first blush, this PI certainly seems to be a vindictive fellow, trying to “punish” his former
graduate students and postdocs for not accompanying him to his new lab by rewriting their
manuscripts so as to diminish or delete their authorship status or claims. If the ethical propriety
of his rewriting was challenged, would he be able to defend himself in any kind of morally
convincing way?
Our response would inquire whether the PI’s rewriting of the manuscripts resulted in an
occasional change of wording or phraseology or whether it resulted in a considerable overhaul
of the papers’ intellectual content. If the papers’ experimental designs, methods, data
gathering, analyses, findings, and implications remained essentially the same after the PI’s
rewrites—such that the original content of the papers remained unchanged—then his behavior
seems disreputable. To the extent that the disfavored investigators’ contributions were
intellectually and substantively retained (and only reworded), their position on the authorship
list should remain unchanged. On the other hand, suppose the PI was unhappy with the work
of the students-who-stayed-behind, deciding that their contributions reflected “poor science.”
His rewrites might be justified if he then proceeds to delete their work or replace it with new
material that they didn’t contribute. To really pass ethical muster, however, he should be able
to make his case for rewriting to some committee or the Office of Research Compliance.
Questions over the second issue of this dilemma, namely about the PI’s claiming a right
to prohibit publication of any research conducted in his lab, might also go to the University’s
Office of Research Compliance. We believe that in instances where the PI and members of his
research team part ways, the individuals who performed the research should retain a moral
right to publish without the PI’s permission, as long as the authorship credits accurately reflect
the investigators’ contributions, are presented in good faith, and comply with the standard
rules on authorship.
As noted in any number of these website cases on authorship, university-based
investigators ordinarily do not own their research—their University does, assuming the grant
award came to it, which is usually the case.
 The research team serves as the University’s subcontractors/employees who promise to execute the research program described in the grant application. Thus, when a PI “takes” a grant with him or her to another institution, it is only with the permission of the University to which the grant was originally awarded. Indeed, the University reserves the right to retain the grant and appoint a new PI. Universities will sometimes not exercise that option upon a PI’s departure, however, because the University might be unable to persuade the grantor that it (the University) could adequately replace the PI and the departing research team so as to keep its contractual promise to do the research. Also, just as universities might “lose” grants when a PI takes a grant and his research team to another institution, so universities “get” grants when new hires bring research awards with them. From a purely ethical perspective, however, a PI’s belief that he has the right to prohibit publications from his laboratory solely because he is the PI is not convincing. From an ethical perspective, the PI must have substantive reasons, usually targeting the quality of the paper’s science, to justify withholding it. As long as a publication is submitted in good faith and complies with the usual expectations of authorship, PIs should welcome rather than prohibit the submission of such publications from their labs. After all, their professional responsibilities include not only discovering and disseminating scientific knowledge but advancing the careers of their laboratory personnel.
Our impression is that PIs often succeed in blocking such publications on pragmatic
rather than moral grounds. For example, an investigator who believes she has written an
excellent paper but wishes to remain employed in a lab will probably not stand up to the PI who
opposes her submitting it. Although she could submit the paper regardless, her PI would likely
become upset upon her doing so and might initiate some punitive action against her.
In the above scenario, however, the PI cannot directly harm his research team members
who stayed behind. Should they wish to submit manuscripts on their own, however, they
would have to consider whether the PI merits an authorship credit per his contribution. If the
PI did make such a contribution but forbids the submission, the authors might just delete the
PI’s contribution from the manuscript—which might prove impossible if the PI conceived and
directed the bulk of the research program. If the investigators could ethically effect such a
deletion and still wish to proceed with the submission, they could exclude the PI as an author
and instead acknowledge him or her at the end of the manuscript —in which case professional
courtesy would require contacting the PI and informing him of the intended submission. At
that point, it is hardly inconceivable that the PI might submit a blistering note to the journal
condemning the manuscript, which could easily doom its chance of publication.
Finally, if the research team would decide to submit the manuscript without any
mention of the PI, they would be well advised to confer with their superiors and perhaps the
University’s Office of Research Compliance. That office might decide, for example, that if the PI
can take his grant with him to another institution, then that implies that he can exert a strong
ownership claim over the data and hence control its dissemination. Thus, even if his intentions
to control publications are maleficently motivated, a PI might be able to block publication of
any papers coming out of his lab because his “ownership” of the data endures.
It is easy to see, then, how these pragmatic considerations and possibilities might
dissuade investigators from submitting papers in opposition to their PIs’ wishes. Yet, if such a
manuscript is actually a solid piece of work, then the losers from its nonpublication are not only
the research team members who wrote it, but the scientific community that is denied the
research findings and, by extension, whoever might someday practically benefit from them.
The easiest way to have averted this entire mess, of course, would have been to have
negotiated all these authorship issues between the PI and his investigators prior to the PI’s
departure. As the case actually unfolded, though, it seems we have a PI whose understanding
of fairness is overwhelmed by feelings of vindictiveness and narcissistic wounding. In response, 
he reverts to morally objectionable strategies to maintain his sense of power. This is the darker
side of scientific work that academic institutions should take into account when they educate
their scientists on responsible conduct in research. While PIs obviously exercise authority, its
fundamental purpose should be focused on doing good research and good science. There is no
reason why the exercise of authority cannot be tempered by a keen sense of humility.
Tyrannical PIs like the one above might indeed be productive, but they hardly qualify as ethical
role models.

4,"George Washington is one of two postdocs working in Dr. Big’s lab. The other postdoc, Dee
Nye, is older and has more years of experience than George, but although she is approaching
the end of her postdoc term, she has no first-author publications nor has she received any
extramural grants. Because Dee will need to leave the lab soon and find a position elsewhere,
there is a keen desire on her and on Dr. Big’s parts to make her marketable. Compounding her
overall lack of productivity is the fact that Dee does not get along very well with her coworkers; her presentations are poorly delivered; and her experimental designs are frequently
flawed.
Dr. Big likes George and tells him that he (i.e., Dr. Big) has taken it upon himself to write
a manuscript with Dee as primary author and that he will create all the necessary figures, albeit
using Dee’s data. He also tells George that he has written a rather complimentary letter for
Dee and embellished her qualifications in order to improve her job prospects.
George thinks that it is exceedingly unfair that Dee can be so unproductive and
unprofessional in the lab, yet emerge from this with someone else writing her manuscripts and
providing a glowing letter of recommendation. When he confesses this to Dr. Big, Dr. Big
answers, “I know, I know. But someday you’ll have to manage a situation like this, and you’ll
just want to be rid of this person. Besides, if I want to make her the first author on a paper, I
have that authority, don’t I?”
George is not convinced by Dr. Big’s argument, but he isn’t going to quarrel with Dr. Big
and he certainly won’t miss Dee Nye. Nevertheless, Dr. Big’s behaviors seem ethically
problematic. Please comment.","Dr. Big might be a fine scientist, but he’s not a good mentor. First, he plans to write a
recommendation letter that will frankly misrepresent Dee’s abilities and interpersonal
behaviors. The practical consequence is that her inadequacies might well follow her to her next
job and continue to cause problems. Dr. Big might argue that he’s working on Dee’s behalf,
thinking perhaps that she just needs more time to develop a more mature set of professional
behaviors. One could alternatively argue, though, that Dr. Big is primarily motivated to be rid of
Dee, and that his true motivation is self-serving (which rarely, if ever, serves as an ethical
justification). Rather than undertaking the effort to improve Dee’s professional conduct and
skills, he takes the less effortful path of misrepresenting her conduct and accomplishments.
(And we are assuming that Dee performed inadequately as described. But is her less than
stellar performance in some way attributable to Dr. Big’s very limited capacity to be a good
supervisor? Did Dr. Big allow and support Dee’s exploring her scientific interests or did he have
her doing relatively unproductive work in the lab, perhaps for his own gain?)
Second, Dr. Big is going to write a paper for Dee and position her as first author. This
will count as a second misrepresentation of Dee’s ability, assuming Dr. Big makes the primary 
intellectual contribution. Of course, it co-opts Dee into committing the same,
misrepresentational offense. Dr. Big is exaggerating Dee’s contributions to the paper, and his
argument that he has the authority to do so certainly doesn’t pass ethical muster. If authority
admits moral connotations—such that the appropriate exercise of authority consists in
modeling moral behavior and insisting that one’s charges do the same—then Dr. Big is
confusing moral authority with power. One is reminded of Socrates’ famous question in the
dialogue Euthyphro: “Is something good because the Gods approve it, or do the Gods approve
of something because it is good?” If Dr. Big is one of the “Gods,” he needs to exercise his
authority in accordance with ethical concerns about the integrity of his lab, his institution, and
all the relationships that are at stake (including the one with Dee’s future employer). Just
because he has “godlike” power doesn’t mean his exercise of it is automatically good.
Third, Dr. Big shares all of this with George, the other postdoc in the lab. Surely, this
counts as an unprofessional conversation. One might see it as a “boundary violation” in that it
muddies the relationship between Dr. Big and George—i.e., George has now become Dr. Big’s
confidant rather than just a mentee. Also, his confiding in George suggests that Dr. Big might
have some uncomfortable awareness of the wrongfulness of his conduct, so he chooses to
confide in someone who, predictably, will not call him on it. By revealing this all to George, Dr.
Big perhaps relieves his conscience, but he takes the less-than-responsible course by passing
this information along to a predictably benign, passive, and nonthreatening individual.
Worse, however, is that just as Dr. Big has co-opted Dee into misrepresenting her
authorship, his confiding all this to George makes George complicit in the misbehavior: If Dr.
Big and Dee’s misrepresentations are ever discovered, and George’s foreknowledge of their
intentions and actions becomes known, he might be harshly penalized for failing to call the
organization’s attention to this turpitude.
For all these reasons, it is difficult not to come down hard on Dr. Big. Quite possibly,
had he intervened in ways that a committed and skilled mentor would when the first signs of
Dee’s professional and relational deficits became apparent, this unpleasant scenario could
have been avoided. Did Dr. Big suffer from excessive optimism, thinking that somehow, as the
years passed in his lab, Dee’s behaviors would magically improve without the need for any
explicit intervention? Indeed, was Dr. Big ever trained in mentoring so as to know what to do
when mentees like Dee first begin presenting problems?
This invites the suspicion that Dr. Big may well be part of an institution that is aiding and
abetting his failures. The institution may be failing to: 1) provide training to its scientists in
mentoring skills in the same way that institutions typically provide ongoing training on grantgetting skills; 2) monitor mentoring conduct, by soliciting reports from mentors about their
mentoring activities and soliciting feedback from mentees about the same; and 3) reward
appropriate mentoring conduct as it rewards success in winning grants, invitations to present
high-profile lectures, membership invitations to prestigious professional associations.
Dr. Big‘s poor mentoring speaks to the need for training programs to be designed and
made available for all persons stepping into a mentoring role, lest one make the huge
inferential error that because someone is a competent and productive scientist, he or she ipso
facto has the pedagogical and management skills to be a decent mentor.
Ultimately, mentorship skills are considerable and complex, and should not be shrugged
off. Mentees deserve very capable supervisors, especially as they progress towards being 
responsible, independent scientists who might, someday, be faced with mentoring challenges
of their own.","%Introduction:

5,"Some years ago, I worked as a bronchoscopy technician on a lung transplant service.
This service maintained a very aggressive post transplant surveillance regimen that was
formally connected with the hospital's translational research efforts.
After lung transplantation, patients were seen 9 or 10 times over the course of
the first year. They routinely had bronchoscopy, which included a saline flush whereby
tissue from the lobe could be collected and then analyzed for signs of infection or
rejection. Additionally, patients underwent transbronchial biopsies with the tissue sent
to pathology for evaluation of developing allograft rejection. The tissue was also sent to
the research labs for collaborative translational studies. Patients also went through a
series of breathing tests, thoracic CT scans, and blood draws during their regular check
ups.
This aggressive follow-up was not without controversy. Many, probably most, in
the field believed it was necessary to detect rejection or infection early so as to
intervene rapidly and as effectively as possible. Others felt that these patients should
be left alone after transplant unless symptoms actually arose. I recall one transplant
group in particular claiming that their center's overall post transplant survival times are
just as good as those at centers that use the more aggressive regimen.
I believed that it was an honest question as to whether the aggressive
management at my facility was, in fact, providing better patient care. The central
problem was that lung graft survival times are less than desired overall and have not
changed much over the past decade. More research is needed to better understand
and be able to predict and treat episodes of lung allograft rejection before total graft
failure occurs and the patient dies. So, it is certainly fair to say that while aggressive
management for both clinical and research purposes might have problematically put the
patient at an increased risk without immediate personal benefit, transplant knowledge
gained through the diligent and extensive collection of clinical and biological data is the
only way to better understand the pathology of lung allograft rejection and why some
treatments do or don't work. Of course, the most likely beneficiaries of this knowledge
will be future patients, not the ones we are currently treating.                                                                                                      The second ethical problem with this research was the collection of lung alveolar
tissue by transbronchial biopsy for both clinical and research purposes. This is a
procedure that poses serious risks with even the possibility of death. However, the
procedure is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of lung allograft rejection. The
problem is that while we wanted to take biopsies for both clinical as well as research
purposes, sometimes the decision had to be made to skip one or the other because of
an occasionally limited ability to obtain tissue.
Multiple biopsies are the gold standard because rejection can be occurring in a
portion of the lung not sampled, thus leading to false negatives. But when the tissue
samples at a particular visit only go to research and the patient eventually goes into
rejection, I have wondered whether we would have caught some of the false negatives
sooner had the samples only gone to the clinical lab.                                                                                                            Perhaps there is no ethical solution to these issues because lung transplantation
is hardly a perfect science. But there certainly seems to be ample room for ethical
reflection on the somewhat conflicting stakes between research and patient care, and
the clinical uncertainties that are part and parcel of lung transplantation. ","One of the problems posed by this dilemma is whether or not it was ethically acceptable
to subject transplant patients to a highly aggressive post-transplant regimen of
procedures to check for allograft rejection. One might argue, as the dilemma
contributor does, that this regimen, which included tests of a purely research as well as
clinical nature, might have disposed patients to excessive or unreasonable risk (not to
mention the unpleasantries involved). Of those tests that serve a purely clinical value,
however, we are of the understanding that “surveillance” bronchoscopies with multiple
(i.e., at least 6) transbronchial biopsies for early detection of clinically occult acute
rejection are the gold standard worldwide, as the number and intensity of acute
rejection episodes are the strongest predictors of subsequent graft dysfunction and
patient death. While there may be some investigators who claim equal results without
this amount of follow-up, those claims do not seem to represent mainstream transplant
understanding and practice. Moreover, our experience with transplant recipients has
shown that they very much desire aggressive follow-up. Consequently, we find the
author’s argument, i.e., that aggressive clinical follow-up is probably what the standard
of care should require, compelling. But what about those tests that are purely of a
research nature—the ones where, according to the dilemma contributor, “the likely
beneficiaries of this knowledge will be future patients, not the ones we are currently
treating”?
If the risk burden of these tests, as measured by the quantity and gravity of
adverse events or complaints, is not deemed excessive or unreasonable by the
institution’s IRB or office of clinical trials, participants simply must be appraised of their
dual role as 1) patients about to undergo transplant and 2) research participants whose
post-transplant experiences will be closely monitored for scientific purposes. They
must be informed that certain of the tests they experience will not help them personally
but will rather help researchers develop better transplant interventions for future
patients.
Acknowledging research participation by way of these informed consent
considerations suggests that patients be allowed to opt out of them, or that they can
rescind their consent at any time. At Emory University, for instance, the physician
performing a bronchoscopy for research purposes confirms that the patient has a signed
research consent form on file and asks at each visit if the individual still wishes to
participate.
The dilemma contributor’s transplant center is having patients fulfill both
research as well as clinical roles, which those patients have a perfect right to know
about. Indeed, one cannot imagine that the informed consent documents these
patients sign would omit that information. Furthermore, one would hope that the
various professionals who are seeing these patients are clearly distinguished from one 
another as clinicians and investigators. To the extent, however, that many of them,
especially physicians, play both roles, conflicts of loyalty can easily occur that could
compromise informed consent discussions with patients. It is possible, in other words,
that clinician-investigators might pose informed consent conversations in such a way
that patients feel they have no choice but to acquiesce to the research studies, or they
might not be made sufficiently aware that certain of the tests have no clinical benefit for
them. The former is coercive while the latter is deceptive. Both, of course, are
unethical.
But the dilemma contributor raises a second problem per his suspicion that
biopsied material was occasionally sent only to the research arm of the study and not to
the clinic, which might have harmed certain patients who went into rejection. While we
will never be able to tell with sufficient confidence whether this investigator’s worries
are legitimate, it is hard to think that the research protocol in this case as vetted by the
institution’s IRB would not have stipulated the frequency and amount of tissue that
would need to be taken to satisfy both patient protection requirements as well as
research objectives. If the actual implementation of the protocol sometimes did not
accommodate or satisfy those stipulations, then it is easy to indict a lack of reporting or
oversight on protocol adherence as the culprit. Note, also, how this recalls the conflict
of loyalty mentioned above: that if a health professional was assigned to care both for
the patient’s clinical needs as well as collect tissue for research, he or she risks
becoming compromised by conflicting demands. (And it would not be terribly difficult
to imagine him or her rationalizing a decision that favors research interests, especially if
the investigators feel very pressured to collect adequate material.)
Still, an IRB would never allow the participants’ personal welfare to be
subordinated to their value as research subjects. So, if a conflict ever had to be
adjudicated about prioritizing where the patient’s tissue would go if it could go to only
one place, i.e., to a research lab or a diagnostic lab, morality would dictate the latter
over the former.
If the technician observed the clinical care of patients being compromised by the
investigators’ research interests, he should have reported it. This brings up the question
as to whether he didn’t think it his job, or that he feared reprisals for doing so, or that
he believed that reporting wouldn’t make a difference. Ideally, everyone on the
research team should feel comfortable bringing up concerns like this, but we know in
practice that such “speaking up” can be excruciatingly difficult to do, especially if, as was
the case here, the would-be whistleblower is someone without much power. On the
other hand, the dilemma contributor might have simply understood his concerns to be
nothing more than uncomfortable suspicions that ultimately lacked evidence. This
leaves us with the interesting and provocative question as to: At what point does a
population like this become “sufficiently” endangered by having their lung tissue go
clinically unexamined because, say, it is diverted to research? Until that question is
confidently answered, moral reflection over the quality of patient protections, the
possibly reckless endangerment of patients, and the design of and adherence to
biobanking protocols will remain inconclusive.


","%Introduction:  
This ethical dilemma highlights the tension between aggressive post-transplant surveillance for lung transplant patients and the potential risks associated with such an approach. It raises questions about the balance between patient care and research objectives, particularly when the benefits of research may not directly impact the patients involved.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the ethical implications of subjecting patients to invasive procedures for both clinical and research purposes, the necessity of informed consent, and the potential conflicts of interest that arise when clinicians also serve as researchers. The risks associated with transbronchial biopsies and the implications of prioritizing research over immediate patient care are central to this dilemma.

6,"Jane is a very motivated and bright graduate student who is trying hard to purify a protein in a
highly specialized area of research. Despite her perseverance, she meets with failure after
failure. Finally, she goes to her PI, Dr. Smith, who is an internationally recognized investigator in
Jane’s area of research, and confesses her problem. The PI is silent for a while and then says,
“Don’t fret. I’ll have something for you to look at tomorrow.” The following day when Jane
arrives at the lab, she sees an unpublished manuscript on her desk with a post-it note from Dr.
Smith that says: “Jane, read the methods and results sections of this paper. I think they might
contain the solution to your problems. But don’t tell anybody I gave you this. As soon as you
are finished, return the paper to me. And don’t make any copies of it.” The paper describes an
experiment that seems exactly suited to solving Jane’s problem. Sure enough and within a few
days, Jane has purified the protein using the approach. She gleefully reports all this to her PI
and returns the paper. She can’t help asking though, “Dr. Smith, I have searched the literature
high and low to find a method to help me with my project and found absolutely nothing. Where
did you get that manuscript?” to which Dr. Smith obliquely replies, “Oh, I’ve got a ton of them.”
Discuss the ethical dimensions of this scenario.","We purposefully omitted describing the origins of the paper Jane read because therein lies the moral
content of this dilemma. The paper could have been written by Dr. Smith or a student in his lab and
never published. Or it could have been a paper that Dr. Smith was reviewing for a peer-reviewed
publication or for the NIH as a research grant application. Or it could have been a paper that had been
reviewed for publication, was accepted, and was awaiting publication in the very near future. With an
understanding of the federal Office of Research Integrity’s characterization of plagiarism as “the theft or
misappropriation of intellectual property and the substantial unattributed textual copying of another’s
work,” 2
 let’s consider each of these possibilities.
Scenario #1: The paper was written by a former student of Dr. Smith’s who was working in Dr. Smith’s
lab at the time. The paper was never published nor was it ever submitted for publication.
Under these circumstances, there shouldn’t be a problem with Jane’s having access to and
working from the paper’s methods and results section. The reason is that Dr. Smith’s university, which
we shall call Exemplary U, probably owns the student’s work as intellectual property.3
 The only way the
student could lay an unproblematic claim to owning the work is if he had already received the
University’s permission for him to copyright the material. If the student never sought copyright
authorization or sought to publish the paper, Dr. Smith—as the university’s representative and under
whose direction and auspices the work was performed—would seemingly have sufficient authority to
allow other investigators in his lab access to it.
As just implied, an interesting twist in this scenario would occur if the paper’s original author,
who let us suppose is now working at another university, would want to publish the paper’s methods or
propose their use in his own NIH application. This situation happens occasionally, as investigators will
work together in a lab on a given project and subsequently go their separate ways. They might think
that they can take their data and methods from their previous workplace without worry because, after 
all, they created them. But their belief about their owning that intellectual property would be quite
problematic without an antecedent contractual agreement with the university at which their work
originally occurred.3
As the original methodology, which we shall call “the work,” was created at Exemplary U, the
university owns it and might wish to exert its property interest in that work.3
 The student investigator
will doubtlessly have signed an employment agreement with Exemplary U acknowledging the latter’s
ownership of his labor. So, if the student, who is now working at another university, would publish that
paper as his own or if his current university would want to patent those methods (i.e., the ones that
Jane used), Exemplary U would have grounds to sue (at least for breach of contract and perhaps
copyright or patent infringement).
Consequently, this scenario doesn’t appear to represent any moral turpitude on Dr. Smith’s
part. Nevertheless, when it comes time for Jane to write up her experiment for publication, she most
certainly should acknowledge her predecessor’s work in supplying the methodology she used. Indeed, if
she decides she wants to cut and paste the wording that describes the methodology from the original
paper, she is ethically obligated to contact the original author and invite him as an author on the paper.
There is a sense in which the wording of the methodology section belongs to him, and Jane would be
plagiarizing if she simply usurped that language and claimed it as her own. (This would not be
essentially different from a situation where Jack and Jill are working in the same lab and Jill appropriates
a paragraph word-for-word from a paper Jack is writing and pastes it in her own manuscript as her own
work.)
So if Jane should wish to publish her work, she must first ask Dr. Smith for the name and contact
information of the student author. Dr. Smith would then be ethically obligated to supply this
information to Jane so that Jane can fulfill her ethical obligations. Indeed, given that Dr. Smith is the
senior researcher in this scenario, he should from the outset reveal to Jane the origin of the work and
inform Jane of her ethical obligations--and his willingness to supply the name and contact information--
should she wish to publish.
Scenario #2: The paper is one that Dr. Smith was recently asked to review for a peer-reviewed
publication or an NIH application. He hasn’t turned in his review yet.
In this scenario, Dr. Smith has certainly committed moral turpitude by sharing the paper with
Jane without permission. Journal reviewers and NIH reviewers pledge confidentiality, at least because
the review process would be entirely unworkable if scientists couldn’t trust reviewers to honor the
identity of the work’s originators or feared that reviewers might steal the paper’s ideas and methods! 4
Smith’s knowledge of this paper along with Jane’s distress presents him with a conflict of loyalty. On the
one hand, he is duty bound to respect his confidentiality agreement with the journal or the NIH. On the
other hand, he feels a duty to help Jane with her research.
But by sharing the work with Jane, he not only violates that confidentiality agreement in
principle, he shows very poor practical judgment in failing to consider how Jane (as well as himself
perhaps) might eventually use the knowledge that obviously isn’t theirs. The Office of Research Integrity
asserts that “The theft or misappropriation of intellectual property includes the unauthorized use of
ideas or unique methods obtained by a privileged communication, such as a grant or manuscript
review.”2
 Thus, suppose Jane and Dr. Smith eventually submit a paper to a peer-reviewed journal or an
application to the NIH that describes the methods they’ll use but that does not acknowledge the source
or the originator of those methods. Notice, once they put forward work to the scientific community—as
in a paper submission or a grant—that derived from another’s work but that they nevertheless and
without authorization represent as theirs, they have committed plagiarism for which they can be
sanctioned severely.
And, unfortunately, that does happen. Alan Price published a paper in 2006 that reviewed 19
plagiarism cases that came to the Federal Office of Research Integrity’s attention.1
Price related one
case involving a professor of pathology “who copied almost all of a grant application on human DNA
telomerase enzyme … which had been given to him in confidence by a peer reviewer. The respondent
(i.e., the pathology professor accused of plagiarism) used it in his own NIH grant application.” 1, p.3

Another rather bizarre case involved a professor of chemistry who was accused by a former colleague
of plagiarizing the latter’s research design ideas from an NIH grant application into his own application.
Upon being accused, the alleged plagiarizer claimed that he had given the application to a postdoctoral
fellow as an academic exercise, and he had not realized that the fellow had actually plagiarized some of
the words from the application, which the alleged plagiarizer then—unknowingly he claimed—
incorporated into his own grant application. When asked to identify the post doctoral student, whose
protection was promised by both ORI and the University, the alleged plagiarizer refused.1, p. 2

What would be comical if the situation wasn’t so unfortunate (and sometimes career-ending) is
how such plagiarists fail to appreciate how their plagiarized work might fall into the very hands of the
person(s) from whom the work was plagiarized! But only a moment’s consideration is needed to be
impressed with that likelihood. Consider Jane’s case. She is working on a highly specialized project to
which only a handful of investigators around the world are devoting substantial effort. She finally finds
the solution to her problem, which doubtless has been generated by just such a specialist. When she
herself submits the work for review without an attribution to the originator of her methods, there is a
high likelihood that that very specialist will be asked to review her work (or eventually come across it)
and that he or she will instantly recognize it as their own. Indeed, of the 19 cases that Price reviewed in
his paper, 8 of them dealt solely with plagiarism. (The other 11 dealt with plagiarism in combination
with falsification or fabrication.) Price wrote that:
All but 1 of these 8 ORI cases of solely plagiarism involved the copying of words and/or ideas in
NIH grant applications, detected by a reviewer, who was in most cases the original applicant
whose own grant application to NIH (or to NSF), or the original author whose own publication,
had been plagiarized; they just happened to become a reviewer for NIH or NSF of the
questioned application and then reported the plagiarism to agency officials.1, p. 4
So, a point in this scenario is that while it is a serious lapse of professional integrity to breach a
confidentiality agreement and allow an unauthorized individual access to another’s confidentially
protected work, going the additional, morally unspeakable step of stealing that work and trying to pass
it off as one’s own might be easily discovered. Doing so combines theft with misrepresentation and can
blemish one’s career in a way from which he or she might never recover.
Scenario #3: The paper has been accepted for publication and will appear soon.
So, here, one might think that the moral thing for Dr. Smith to do would be to contact the author of the
paper and ask for permission to share the paper with Jane and allow her to replicate the experiment.
Once the author grants permission, then all things should proceed smoothly. If the author refuses, then
Jane must wait until the paper appears in print.
In fact, though, Dr. Smith needs to contact the journal editors first and secure their permission
for him to contact the author at least because 1) the journal owns the copyright to the material and
might wish to control its dissemination before it appears in wide circulation, and 2) the journal might
wish to keep Dr. Smith’s identity, as a reviewer, unknown to the author (and so refuse Dr. Smith’s
request). 4

Generally, if the journal has no problem with a request like Dr. Smith’s, an editor will contact the
author and inquire if he or she would entertain a request like Smith’s. The author might approve but
with stipulations—such that the paper can be read and discussed by members of a particular lab but not
disseminated to anyone else; or the author might stipulate that the paper can be read and discussed but 
none of the novel research methods described in the paper can be tried by anyone until the paper is
published. Or the author might deny the request altogether—perhaps because his institution wishes to
patent some of the paper’s intellectual work and the patent application process is taking longer than
expected. Interestingly, an author might be able to publish a paper and then patent its ideas later, but
doing so is tricky. Shamoo and Resnik note that:
If investors publish their ideas (or someone else does) prior to filing a patent, this may prevent
them from obtaining a patent on their inventions in most countries. However, the U.S. patent
laws have a one-year grace period from publication to patent. Thus, in the United States,
investors can publish first and patent later. However, they may submit a provisional patent
application with the U.S. Patent and Trade Office when they submit for publication, to protect
their proprietary interest before filing a patent. 3, p. 126
In conclusion, the temptation to use another scientist’s work product might be considerable and, based
on past history, certain persons will succumb to that temptation. The typical penalties handed down by
the NIH for plagiarism include the plagiarist’s having to certify through an institutional official that his or
her future grant applications and reports cite all sources appropriately; and/or the ORI can prohibit
plagiarists from serving on Public Health Service advisory committees, such as grant study sections for a
period of time (e.g., 2 to 10 years); or the plagiarist can be barred from receiving grants for a specific
period.1

One cannot fail to be impressed by how today’s investigators must not only be technically
scrupulous in their labs, but morally scrupulous as well. By sharing the manuscript with Jane, Dr. Smith
might be doing something morally unproblematic or he might be inviting disaster into his and Jane’s
careers. The devil is often in the details, but it will be the details or the circumstances of cases like these
that inform their moral status. ","%Introduction:

7,"I once worked in a lab that conducted anti-aging research. The lab was operated by Dr. Smith,
who also owned and operated an assisted living facility nearby.
Dr. Smith was intrigued by homeopathic remedies that he thought might slow the aging
process and improve quality of life. His research centered on vitamin and nutritional
supplements, topical creams and salves, exercise programs and so on. Laboratory personnel
were constantly going to the assisted living facility and drawing blood, taking skin samples,
measuring bone density and respiratory capacity and the like.
I began feeling uncomfortable when I noticed that some of our research participants,
who had early senility or dementia and had little idea of what was going on, had their consent
to research participation signed by Dr. Smith. When I asked him about this, he looked a bit
anxious but told me that these individuals had signed over their power-of-attorney to him upon
entering the facility, and that he was therefore allowed to make decisions for them, including
research participation.
When we were informed that we were going to be visited by some representatives of a
grant foundation that might fund our work, Dr. Smith explicitly told us to say that we knew
nothing about how our various biological specimens were procured. He also told us to say that
our current research was on the cusp of success even though none of our assays had indicated
anything unique or exciting. He also made a point to remind all of us of the confidentiality and
nondisclosure stipulations in our employment contracts, which sounded like a veiled threat
should any of us discuss some of Smith’s problematic practices with the funding team or any
other outsiders.
We did not get the grant, and after a few months, I simply couldn’t tolerate the situation
any longer, and I left. Please comment.","""I once worked in a lab that conducted anti-aging research. The lab was operated by Dr. Smith,

Dr. Smith was intrigued by homeopathic remedies that he thought might slow the aging
process and improve quality of life. His research centered on vitamin and nutritional
supplements, topical creams and salves, exercise programs and so on. Laboratory personnel
were constantly going to the assisted living facility and drawing blood, taking skin samples,
measuring bone density and respiratory capacity and the like.
I began feeling uncomfortable when I noticed that some of our research participants,
who had early senility or dementia and had little idea of what was going on, had their consent
to research participation signed by Dr. Smith. When I asked him about this, he looked a bit
anxious but told me that these individuals had signed over their power-of-attorney to him upon
entering the facility, and that he was therefore allowed to make decisions for them, including
research participation.
When we were informed that we were going to be visited by some representatives of a
grant foundation that might fund our work, Dr. Smith explicitly told us to say that we knew
nothing about how our various biological specimens were procured. He also told us to say that
our current research was on the cusp of success even though none of our assays had indicated
anything unique or exciting. He also made a point to remind all of us of the confidentiality and
nondisclosure stipulations in our employment contracts, which sounded like a veiled threat
should any of us discuss some of Smith’s problematic practices with the funding team or any
other outsiders.
We did not get the grant, and after a few months, I simply couldn’t tolerate the situation
any longer, and I left. Please comment.""","%Introduction:  
This dilemma highlights serious ethical concerns regarding informed consent, the treatment of vulnerable populations, and the integrity of scientific research practices. The actions of Dr. Smith raise questions about the ethical responsibilities of researchers, particularly when dealing with individuals who may not fully understand their participation in research.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the validity of consent obtained from individuals with cognitive impairments, the ethical implications of using power-of-attorney for research participation, and the potential exploitation of vulnerable populations. Additionally, the pressure to misrepresent research findings for funding purposes further complicates the ethical landscape.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
The principles of biomedical ethics, particularly autonomy, beneficence, and justice, are relevant here. Historical cases of unethical research practices, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, underscore the importance of informed consent and the protection of vulnerable populations. The concept of ""vulnerable subjects"" in research ethics emphasizes the need for additional safeguards when working with individuals who may lack the capacity to consent.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
To address these ethical issues, it is crucial to implement robust oversight mechanisms, such as an independent ethics review board that evaluates research protocols involving vulnerable populations. Training for researchers on ethical standards and informed consent processes is also essential. Additionally, establishing clear reporting channels for unethical practices can empower lab personnel to voice concerns without fear of retaliation.

%Key Takeaways:  
This case underscores the importance of ethical integrity in research, particularly when working with vulnerable populations. It highlights the need for transparent practices, informed consent, and accountability in scientific research to protect participants and uphold the credibility of the scientific community.","%Introduction:

8,"I had decided to submit my first abstract ever for a neuroscience conference that I very much
wanted to attend. My research consisted of running human subjects through an fMRI scan so
as to collect brain activation data in response to simple visual stimuli. My data and analyses
appeared solid as the time drew near for me to write the abstract, so I was excited and eager to
proceed. My postdoc slowed me down, however, with a suggestion that I include a few more
subjects in the study. I agreed but voiced a concern that the submission deadline was coming
up. “Maybe you can use yourself in your study,” he said. “I mean, it’s only an abstract that
you’re submitting, and you can recruit more subjects between now and the conference and
make corrections accordingly.”
I was uneasy about using myself as a subject. I felt it was somehow unethical even
though I knew there was no way I could bias the results of the study due to the simplicity of the
paradigm I was using. Luckily, I was spared the problem: The next day my postdoc recruited
some subjects for the study so I avoided having to use myself. However, I still wonder what
would have happened if new subjects were not recruited. It was such a simple experiment that
I couldn’t have affected the results. But would recruiting myself be considered a conflict of
interest or be somehow unethical? ","In reflecting on this scenario, we were reminded of Hans Jonas’s famous essay “Philosophical
Reflections on Experimenting with Human Subjects,” which was originally published in 1969
and represented one of the early attempts to perform bioethical analysis from a secular rather
than religious or theological perspective.
According to that essay, Jonas would very much approve of our young investigator’s
self-recruitment. Jonas asserted that investigators themselves are ideal research participants
because:
If it is full, autonomous identification of the subject with the purpose that is required for
the dignifying of his serving as a subject—here it is; if strongest motivation—here it is; if
fullest understanding—here it is; if freest decision—here it is; if greatest integration
with the person’s total, chosen pursuit—here it is…By himself the scientist is free to
obey his obsession, to play his hunch, to wager on chance, to follow the lure of
ambition. It is all part of the “divine madness” that somehow animates the ceaseless
pressing against frontiers.
So, Jonas is arguing that nonmanipulation, motivation, and acute understanding of and
identification with the research goals are best exhibited by the investigators themselves.
Furthermore, if we worry about whether an individual’s participation in research is justified
given the risks, then the investigator’s passion and commitment to scientific discovery should
remove that anxiety and recommend his or her qualifications for participation in the strongest
terms possible. 
Complimenting Jonas’s argument, the history of scientific discovery is replete with
instances where investigators recruited themselves in their experiments. Perhaps the most
remarkable example is Barry Marshall, an Australian gastroenterologist who proved that most
stomach ulcers are caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori by drinking a solution that
contained the microbe in 1982.
 He and his colleague Robin Warren shared the Nobel Prize for
Medicine in 2005 in recognition of their discovery. After successful inoculation with monkeys,
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine on himself, his wife and his children. Werner Forssman was
awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in medicine for his work on heart catheterization. He inserted a
catheter into his vein until it reached the right atrium of his heart and then took an X-ray of the
placement to prove it could work. Kevin Warwick, a British robotics researcher, implanted
electrodes in his body (and later in his wife’s) that could send signals to a robotic arm. His
discovery that impulses could be sent from the human nervous system to an artificial one
spurred the “transhumanist” movement, which is interested in the ethical use of electronic
augmentation or enhancement of the natural human body.
Unfortunately, not all such self-recruitment in scientific history ended as well as these.
In the early nineteenth century, Humphry Davy and Horace Wells became addicted to nitrous
oxide and chloroform respectively, as they investigated their anesthesiological properties.
(Davy’s chronic use incapacitated him for the last 20 years of his life, while Wells committed
suicide.)
 Daniel Alcides Carrion died in 1885 at the age of 28 when he had a friend inject him
with blood drawn from the wart of a 14-year old suffering from what was then called Oroya
fever. Carrion developed the disease and died. In his honor, Oroya fever—which was at
epidemic levels in Peru when Carrion studied it—was renamed Carrion Disease and the
Peruvian government recognizes October 5, the day of Carrion’s death, as Peruvian Medicine
Day.
And then there are Elizabeth Ascheim Woolf, Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin who all
died of radiation exposure from their use of X-ray technology. Ascheim and her husband set up
for the first X-ray laboratory in San Francisco and experimented with the technology unaware
of its dangers.
Rosalind Franklin would surely have shared the Nobel Prize with Watson, Crick
and Wilkins in 1962 for the discovery of DNA. But Franklin died from ovarian cancer in 1958,
almost certainly as a result of her using X-ray crystallography to decipher the B form of the
helical structure of the DNA molecule.
Per the above scenario and pace Hans Jonas, contemporary ethics would probably
recommend a very conservative course as to whether or not an investigator should recruit him
or herself for an experiment. One fear is that if the investigator doesn’t suffer from the disease
being studied, he or she may feel a need to acquire it in order to test his or her hypothesis, as
Barry Marshall did. But an investigator’s intentionally introducing a disease into his or her body
can be strikingly antithetical to the utilitarian goal of achieving net utility. If the investigator
takes significant risks with his or her welfare, the promise of the research deliverable, i.e., the
end for which these efforts are being sought, is frankly imperiled. Had Jonas Salk’s injection of
the polio vaccine resulted in his being permanently incapacitated from the disease (or from
something related), the world would have to await another discoverer, which could have taken
years. One is reminded of the airline safety precaution to parents traveling with family if
oxygen in the cabin is discontinued: When the safety masks drop down, first place one on 
yourself and then help others. Inordinate altruism may result in a self-sacrifice that can
ultimately produce a significant net disutility.
Arguing from a deontological perspective, research participants largely serve as a means
to the end of hypothesis confirmation or the aggregation of beneficial, generalizable
knowledge. Nevertheless, we try to treat research participants as ends in themselves both
through the informed consent process as well as insisting on IRB protections, such that
participants are not subjected to more than minimal risk (save in exceptional cases that might
favorably and directly impact their welfare). Consequently, the investigator who first enrolls
himself in his own trial—which is a trial of 1, of course—before going through an IRB approval
process can be assuming too much risk and should be protected from his or her risky behavior.
Furthermore, and contrary to Jonas’s assertion that the investigator is the one best able
to give informed consent, one might argue that some researchers are so blinded by ambition or
the opportunity for prestige that they are unable to offer a truly voluntary and thoughtful
consent to participation in an experiment where the risks might be unreasonably high.
Of course and from a purely methodological perspective, an N of 1 is just that: a single
data point that can hardly count as generalizable knowledge. While some might find Salk’s
injecting himself with the polio vaccine admirable—less so, his injecting his wife and especially
less so his children—all it would have confirmed is that it was safe for him and his family but
possibly not safe for the family next door.
In the above scenario, however, safety does not appear to be a significant concern as
indicated by the millions of persons who have had MRIs without incident. We worry instead
about our young investigator’s participation from another angle: Might the findings on his
brain function be skewed by his familiarity with the research and its purpose?
On the one hand, if the investigator’s research goal is purely descriptive, i.e, motivated
by an interest in discerning the neural activation patterns of a particular visual stimulus such
that nothing beyond that descriptive aim is desired, then his participation is probably
acceptable. On the other hand, if a research hypothesis has been forwarded, e.g., “visual
stimuli of this or that sort will activate brain regions X, Y and Z,” then it might be the case that
the investigator’s foreknowledge of that hypothesis can bias his neural responses to the stimuli
in favor of the hypothesis.
This argument is hardly idle. Commentators discussing the substitution of fMRI for
polygraphy in lie detection have commented that the current state of the technology in no way
argues for such (assuming it even argues for the merits of polygraphy). Just as individuals have
learned to fool polygraphy, e.g., by biting their tongues or pressing their toes to the floor, they
might just as well fool an MRI by concentrating on feelings, thoughts or images that, with
enough know-how on their part, might produce findings that “prove” their testimony.
Consequently, it appears that we should be very cautious, even hesitant, about the idea
of researchers recruiting themselves for experiments. If the research posed minimal risks and
there is no compelling reason to think that the investigator could skew or bias his or her test
results in the direction of some research hypothesis, then his or her participation is probably
acceptable. If, however, the risks are considerable and/or a biased result from the
investigator’s participation is indeed possible, then that researcher’s participation would be
morally problematic and so should be disallowed. Ultimately, a researcher who enrolls him or
herself in an experiment before any other subjects are enrolled and especially before a 
sufficient amount of data collection among animals has occurred is acting rashly and is not
furthering the cause of science.

9,"One of the oddest but most memorable experiences I ever had in my graduate and postgraduate training occurred one morning when I got to the lab rather early. Our lab was
a large one, and had recruited a number of fine, junior investigators from Southeast
Asia. As I hung up my coat, I glanced into an adjacent room and saw three of them
apparently praying over their experimental materials. They were standing around their
lab table. Their eyes were tightly shut, and they were obviously chanting a prayer, all
the while making circular arm movements with their palms outstretched over the
experiment. I quickly moved away, and I don’t think they saw me.
This may sound crazy but is that ethical? I mean, can you ethically argue that
researchers should not pray over their experiments because such activity might
heighten their interpretational biases or—and this is where things really get vague—
introduce some kind of “contaminating variable” into the experiment? I mean, there
have been research studies on the power of prayer in medicine with some studies
actually showing positive results.
I’ll never forget this provocative and rather touching experience. It posed such a
contrast, or maybe I should say a confluence, between deeply felt and applied
spirituality with the objective, scientific mindset of Western research. But should the
lab director condone this sort of thing as a regular practice? Do you think it poses any
cause for ethical or professional concern?","This scenario speaks to lab management issues in terms of personnel behaviors
affecting the work atmosphere, as well as to metaphysical issues that involve Western
notions of scientific realism, causality, and objectivity.
Why might many Western investigators feel uncomfortable about this scenario?
Paradoxically, if the traditional paradigm of Western science would categorically dismiss
the possibility of divine intervention affecting a lab experiment, then why shouldn’t we
simply allow the lab personnel to pray as they wish and leave them alone? On the other
hand, one might argue that the opportunity for a Hawthorne-like effect is present as the
lab personnel might improve the quality of their work with the adoption of some formal,
group prayer practice.
So, one response to the scenario might be that if such ritualistic
praying is allowed and it occurs, it should be duly documented in the laboratory
notebooks, described in any reports or manuscript submissions, and maintained in all
significant experimental moments (e.g., praying over the control as well as the
experimental arms of a project) since some might understand it as a significant
experimental variable.
Perhaps an equally concerning issue is whether or not the practice of group
prayer in the laboratory disturbs the objectivity of the praying investigators. Does it so
heighten or reinforce their expectation of or desire for a specific experimental result
that their objectivity might be compromised, such that they might be more subjectively
inclined to claim the confirmation of their hypothesis when others would disagree?
Might the prayerful have their objectivity disturbed as, for example, believing that their
data and their interpretation of the data are divinely blessed? Or might the prayerful be
requesting a divine favor such that their team be blessed in being the first in making the
great discovery, which certainly sounds like self-interested praying? But many, if not all,
investigators aim and hope for and perhaps even sometimes pray for a particular result.
The question of blemished or corrupted objectivity is probably best managed in the
traditional way: by reasonable oversight or peer review in the lab, such that solid
hypotheses are framed, and researchers discuss and justify their data gathering and
findings with their peers.
Should we be troubled by the prayerful investigators invoking some kind of
metaphysical intercession? Don’t clinicians occasionally pray with their patients,
especially the ones about to undergo surgeries and the like? We recently heard a story
about hospital staff who prepare the packages of surgical tools that are to be used in
their hospital’s operating rooms.
The names of patients are printed on the orders, and
some of the staff remarked that as they fill the order, they quietly say a prayer for each
and every patient’s recovery. Remarkably, one staff member admitted to performing
this prayer practice for over forty years.
Why does a story like this seem so heart-warming, while praying over a lab
experiment seems problematic? The answer is that clinical interventions do not
primarily involve a search for truth but seek to accommodate the self-interests of
patients (by way of relieving their suffering, curing their ills or diseases, etc.).
The practice of medicine would not exist without self-interested consumers, and it is
precisely those self-interests that medicine seeks to accommodate whenever possible.
The practice of research, however, is primarily and fundamentally motivated by an
interest in uncovering the truth. Its practice is fundamentally epistemological: to
confirm a hypothesis or create generalizable knowledge. Of course, that knowledge
might ultimately advance another’s self-interests, such as the patient who ultimately
benefits from a new, FDA approved antibiotic or antidepressant. But the anticipation of
relief from suffering and royalties to the drug’s discoverers must occupy a second place
to the investigator’s primary moral obligations of protecting research participants from
unnecessary or unreasonable harm and taking pains to insure the integrity of his or her
data.
How, then, might this phenomenon be managed? First of all, if a lab director
forbade such a practice, would he or she be infringing on the prayers’ freedom of
religious expression? Must the lab director make a “reasonable accommodation” for the
prayers, such as allowing them to pray in the very early morning? Probably not. Because
praying over an experiment is not a traditional or customary expression of religious
worship, one could assert that it is not a reasonable accommodation issue. It is hard to
imagine the prayers persuasively arguing that the only place they can pray is in a
laboratory, while it is easy to imagine that certain personnel praying in a laboratory
might significantly disturb the lab’s psychological or work atmosphere.
On the other hand, and especially depending on whether the laboratory is
located in a state or religiously affiliated institution, might other lab personnel not only
not be disturbed by the practice, but welcome it? If so, the lab director might want to
discern how the prayer practice is being perceived by other staff. How do they
understand the practice’s effect on the research being conducted and, especially, on
reporting experimental results? How does it affect other work being done? The lab
director must carefully ask him or herself “What exactly ought I be responding to here?”
(and, even then, be very thoughtful about how his or her own biases might affect the
answers).
Should the institution develop a policy on this? Does it matter, for example,
whether the experiment is federally or privately funded? Should these questions be
clarified by the institution’s office of legal affairs? Would it be acceptable for the
institution to leave the matter entirely up to the discretion of any of its lab directors,
such that they could categorically forbid the practice, or only allow it before or after the
lab’s customary hours of operation, or allow prayer to be practiced at any time?
Ultimately, this scenario recalls Horst Rittel’s and Melvin Webber’s 1973
discussion of the “wicked problem.”
Wicked problems are invariably multifactorial;
their very articulation is problematic as different persons will disagree on what the true
or real problem is; suggestions at resolving the problem only generate more problems;
no resolution seems more than tentative; and the core of the problem appears to
involve vague, ever-changing, or inconsistent phenomena.
There appears to be no decisive resolution to this scenario as different persons
will understand and weigh the questions and issues articulated above differently. The
idea of a ritual prayer practice over an experiment seems to challenge if not contradict
Western comprehensions of scientific method, but there is no way to prevent entirely
those who insist on its practice. The challenge is to evolve a management strategy in
the lab that is fair and respectful to the prayers, that respects the sensibilities of others,
and that does not compromise the integrity of research findings.

Dr. Smith’s lab. Now, this college did not receive many grants, but Dr. Smith was recognized throughout
the school (and frankly envied by a lot of his colleagues) as a real rainmaker. Despite the rather humble
resources of the college, Smith was always getting money to run and grow his lab, and he turned out a
number of students over the years who went on to have significant careers in science.
I was doing some extra-credit work in his lab, frankly hoping to be able to add material to my
resume as I was applying to veterinary school. I was finishing a preliminary project and had gotten some
very preliminary, but very interesting data. With graduation looming, however, I was discouraged that I
couldn’t replicate them. Naturally, I reported this to Dr. Smith, and we worked on it some. But to no
avail: we simply could not replicate the original findings.
I then had to write a final report on this project which we would send to the funding agency for
grant continuation. I duly noted the nature of the experiments, the preliminary data, and the fact that
repeated attempts to replicate the data failed. I turned the report into Dr. Smith, but when he gave me
the final copy that he was sending to the funding agency, I noticed that he had deleted the sentences
about the data replication failures.
I asked him why, and he said that it was abundantly clear in the report that this data was very
preliminary and was not at all being described as definitive. Second, he remarked that my project was
one of three others that he was reporting on, and that these projects were much farther along and more
important to the grantor. He felt that my findings were relatively insignificant in comparison to the
others so there wasn’t any point in belaboring my current failure to replicate my results. Third, he
pointed out that it might still be possible to replicate the data. He speculated that perhaps my samples
had gotten contaminated and that if we had a few more months to work on it, we’d confirm my original
results.
And that was it. I graduated and moved on. But Dr. Smith’s omitting mention of my replication
failures has always stuck in my memory. Was it wrong or was he justified? ","So, the dilemma contributor tells us that she got some interesting, but very preliminary data per an
experiment she was performing. She then, after repeated attempts, utterly failed to replicate the
original findings. In editing the dilemma contributor’s final report, Dr. Smith—the dilemma contributor’s
advisor and lab supervisor—deletes mention of the replication failures and only mentions the positive
findings. When questioned, Dr. Smith offers three reasons:
1) The experimental data are very preliminary, so they might be confirmed or disconfirmed at
some future time. In Smith’s mind, this preliminarity morally justifies the selective omission of
the replication failures in the report.
2) Because other projects in the lab are farther along, the focus of the report must be on them.
This seems to justify a brief, but nevertheless positive mention of the original findings without a
need to belabor the details of the replication failures.
3) Perhaps the replication failures are the result of contamination of the student’s samples,
such that the original findings will ultimately turn out to be true.
This case scenario is an interesting one as it invites a discussion of the important phenomenon of
“motivated reasoning.”
Motivated reasoning has attracted scholarly attention for nearly twenty years and draws on
even older theories, especially dissonance and attribution theory.
 Taken together, the core premises of motivated reasoning are that people usually will be 1) motivated to reduce the unpleasantness of  conflicting or dissonant beliefs, by 2) evaluating such dissonant information on the basis of how well it coincides with their own deeply held values, or about issues in which they have a serious, personal stake, or according to their self-understanding as worthwhile, competent, adequate, decent human beings.
 In a word, motivated reasoning holds that individuals will predictably reach conclusions that
nicely corroborate or are synchronous with the beliefs and values they already hold very dear and which
often sustain or are significant aspects of their self-identity.
Consequently, when it comes to cognitive materials that strike at issues about which we have
strong, antecedently formed notions, we will “reason” in reverse. Consciously or unconsciously, one
“knows” the conclusion one wants to reach before the data are presented. As that data are being
presented, he or she rather automatically rejects, (re)arranges, saliences, “massages,” or simply ignores
certain ones such that the conclusion that is secured is the one that he or she prefers.
One does not have to be a moral psychologist to grant the persuasiveness of motivated
reasoning theory. What kind of “objective evidence” would it take to turn a die-hard liberal like Teddy
Kennedy into a die-hard conservative like Rush Limbaugh and vice versa? What would it take to turn a
rabid anti-abortionist into a staunch supporter of a woman’s right to choose? What kind of evidence
would be required to persuade the Pope that God doesn’t exist or turn a staunch gun-control advocate
into a card carrying member of the NRA? The motivated reasoning theorist would say that virtually any
intellectual effort at ideological conversion in these cases will fail. Each individual would hold onto his
beliefs unshakably and not be deterred by even the most factually compelling, logically powerful
arguments the other side offers. Each would counterargue by ignoring evidence contrary to his cause or
reinterpret or rewrite that evidence such that it fits his or her ideology. As noted above, the motivated
reasoner already knows the conclusion he or she will reach. One simply selectively chooses and
arranges the premises, reasons, or evidence to infer it.
And so we return to Dr. Smith. He is the school’s rainmaker and has turned out a large number
of students over the years who have gone on to have significant careers in science. Doubtlessly, he
holds himself, his lab, and his lab’s deliverables in high esteem (or, at least, he is anxious about
maintaining that public reputation). To him, the public admission of repeated failures to replicate
certain initially interesting, provocative findings is very distasteful and implies defeat. It doesn’t
comport with his vision of his lab’s deliverables and, of course, he needs no reminding of the apparent
bias in scientific publications for positive findings.
 Not surprisingly, the reasons he gives above are
motivated to provide just the conclusion he wants: omit mentioning the replication failures. So let us
review Dr. Smith’s (motivated) reasoning.
If, as the first reason suggests, the data are very preliminary, then it is hard to understand why
that preliminarity somehow favors publishing the positive results but doesn’t equally apply to
acknowledging the replication failures. If one is going to only publish half the data, why favor the
positive half? Indeed, given the repeated but failed attempts to replicate the positive findings, one
might argue that the negative data are less preliminary and more robust than the positive findings.
The second argument—that because other projects are much farther along, we won’t dwell on
yours—is odd: “We will just briefly highlight the positive findings of your preliminary experiment, and
then quickly move on to the more serious material.” This thinking attempts to shift attention away from
the distress of considering the replication failures and one’s moral obligation to present them. It is an
excellent example of motivated reasoning by way of causing an attentional shift from unpleasant
considerations to things that are much more comfortable to ponder.
The third argument—that if we had more time, we might be able to replicate those positive
findings after all—is wishful thinking masquerading as rational argument. If there is no current evidence
that the experimental samples are contaminated, why give that speculation so much credibility? The
answer is because the speculation corroborates the desired or preferred course of action, which is to
note the positive findings and omit mention of the replication failures.
Believing as true only the data I want to is antithetical to science. While the above scenario is
only a report to a funding agency for grant continuation, one might argue that the purposeful deletion
of relevant material is just as ethically indefensible as submitting massaged, incomplete, or otherwise
untruthful data for publication. With grant money increasingly insufficient to fund the growing number
of competitive, highly ranked proposals, deceit in a grant continuation report (or an application that
cites previous work) can have downstream consequences just as damaging to the advancement of
science as a faulty publication.
Sooner or later, of course, replicability is supposed to win out. In the meantime, partial data
reporting only slows down the scientific engine and can create a great deal of needless effort among
other scientists. Further and as noted in other expert opinions on this website, the publication of
negative findings can sometimes be much more valuable than publishing positive ones. Perhaps the
scientific community will support stricter requirements for posting negative lab and trial results, and
penalties for failure to do so. Registering clinical trials, where all data must be reported, is certainly a
step in the right direction.
 Dr. Smith should have appreciated all this more. He should have had his
student publish both the positive and negative findings; have her speculate on reasons for the
replication failures; and not have presented her with an instance of motivated reasoning.

11,"My PI and I were working on an experiment to see if Y occurred when a particular gene was
knocked out. If Y did indeed occur, we would be keen to publish the finding. Determining
whether or not Y occurred would require our doing some assays.
The problem was that assay #1 confirmed Y, but assay #2 disconfirmed Y. It must be
noted that these were not duplicate assays but completely different ones. And repeated assays
of both types kept giving us the same contradictory findings.
So, the first issue was the temptation to simply tell my PI of the preferred result, namely
the one that confirmed Y. I told myself this wouldn’t be a lie, but it came close. So, I told the PI
about both assays. At this point we were confronted with the following decisions: Should we
publish (and therefore believe) the results from the assay that worked and disregard the “bad”
one, assuming that the problem involved some flaw in that assay? Or should we mention in the
publication that we were only able to show Y with one assay, and not with another? Or should
we try a third assay and go with it (as a tie-breaker)?
We went with the last strategy which fortunately confirmed Y and justified our paper.
But suppose there wasn’t a third assay available? What then? ","The literature calls the kind of temptation the dilemma contributor describes an instance of
“selective reporting.”
 Although not exactly a manipulation of data, selective reporting is more
a kind of “editing” one’s findings such that the data that are reported put those findings in the
best possible light. While the above case concerns the temptation to withhold disconfirming
test results, other instances of selective reporting might involve deleting data points,
succumbing to pressures by a commercial research sponsor to report on only one aspect of a
study (e.g., superior outcomes rather than worrisome adverse events), using percentages rather
than actual numbers (so as to omit mentioning that the actual sample size was very small),
applying multiple statistical tests to the same data set but only reporting the test(s) that yield
the most favorable results, and ignoring mention of prior research that challenge the stated
findings.
One cannot help but recall the Vioxx scandal, which began with the publication of the
VIGOR study in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2000.
The authors of that
study omitted their finding that Vioxx carried a five-times higher risk for myocardial infarction,
thrombo-embolic events, hypertension and heart failure than the comparator, naproxen.
 By
the time the VIGOR study appeared, however, the FDA had already approved Vioxx despite
knowing about the elevated cardiovascular risks. (Apparently, the FDA accepted the
investigators’ rather remarkable explanation that Vioxx’s apparent risks were actually due to “a
potential cardioprotective effect of the comparator drug.”) By 2002, however, the FDA
had received enough reports of adverse cardiovascular events associated with Vioxx to prompt
requiring Vioxx’s manufacturer, Merck Sharpe & Dohme, to list those risks in Vioxx’s package
insert. By 2004, when the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention On Vioxx) study appeared
and confirmed Vioxx’s dangerous risk profile, Merck voluntarily withdrew the drug worldwide.
Our reason for recalling the Vioxx case is that its lessons speak directly to the above
case: The reporting of research or clinical results must contemplate other investigators or
clinicians repeating those experiments or interventions. Investigators who simply want to
publish findings that support their hypotheses suffer from a kind of professional or ethical
myopia. Did the Vioxx investigators really think that the drug’s side effect profile would go 
unnoticed ad infinitum? If they believed their research was competently performed, did they
think that Vioxx’s consumers wouldn’t begin demonstrating precisely the kinds of cardiovascular
symptoms that the study participants did? Vioxx is perhaps an extreme case, but that’s why it’s
worth remembering. The consequences of selective reporting can be catastrophic: Consumers
profoundly harmed, professional careers trashed, the public’s trust in science seriously eroded,
and extremely costly litigation waiting in the wings.
Specific to the case above, bench scientists would likely assert that one ought never rely
on only one experimental approach.
 Indeed, very rarely is any one assay result definitive.
Because it can be maddeningly difficult to control for all the variables that can affect a result or
a finding, one generally wants to test one’s hypothesis in as many ways as one can. The
research team that selectively reports data from a single assay will likely arouse the suspicions
of any competent reviewer, who will wonder why other assays weren’t performed.
This will especially be the case if the investigator’s experimental question has a
significant history. That history will probably frame or suggest the number and kinds of assays
the scientific community will expect to be reported, enumerate the variables to be controlled,
describe the potential for misinterpreting findings (e.g., sometimes an experiment succeeds but
not necessarily for the reasons the investigators posit) and suggest which data to believe, which
to doubt, and which to report.
Nevertheless, there can be considerable value in reporting results that are inconsistent
as well as consistent with the hypothesis. In the above scenario, if a third assay wasn’t possible,
the investigators would have done well by their colleagues to have reported the results of both
assays. That way their peers will have a truthful and complete rendering of the experiment and
its results, whereas a partial or selective presentation of data slows the engine of science: Other
researchers will have to discover the partiality of the data, call professional attention to it, and
fill in the gaps—all of which can take a great deal of time. (This is one reason why reporting
negative data can be so valuable, and why investigators often lament the apparent journalistic
bias against it.)
Investigators who encounter disconfirming as well as confirming data might greatly
benefit from peer advice and recommendations on how to present such findings. One question
to ask, for example, is whether or not there is historical precedent for the discrepant assay
results and what the explanation might be. We are not told in the scenario what kinds of assays
are being carried out, e.g., in vivo or in vitro; nor can we identify certain experimental conditions
that might account for discrepancies, e.g., temperature, the use of a particular dye or stain, etc.;
nor are we told about the finding of interest, e.g., a cellular structure or a behavior. Of course, it
might be the case that the reason for the negative or disconfirming result is a faulty design or
errors in the assay. Unlike clinical lab determinations that are done thousands of times and, one
hopes, have reasonably good of quality control, this is often not feasible for most research lab
determinations.
In any event, because assays are unnatural intrusions into natural processes, the more
that investigators deploy multiple approaches that control for those variables (and possible
errors) and that can support results, the more those results will appear confirmed. To reiterate:
If an obvious, confirmatory test is not carried out, the investigators should be prepared to
explain why.
Ultimately, selective data reporting retards the efficiency and momentum of scientific
discovery; it can waste huge amounts of money; and, as the Vioxx case illustrated, it can pose
great harm to research participants and health care consumers. As Marco and Larkin have
pointed out, scientific research that is publicly funded but that is incompetently or unethically
performed is a violation of the social contract in research.
That contract at least anticipates the 
truthful and honest reporting of research data in return for the funds that make the
experiments possible. The investigator who knowingly and intentionally reports only that
fraction of his data that puts his experiment in the best light has reneged on the social contract
and has fallen victim to his self-interests. And because scientific research and clinical care are
inevitably self-policing, succumbing to such selfish inclinations might not only harm the public
that scientific research is supposed to benefit, but end the careers of otherwise talented and
hard-working investigators.

12,"By the time a researcher is a post-Doc, the odds are pretty good that he or she has probably heard if not
actually experienced an instance of an individual leaving a lab and taking his or her lab notebook along.
For obvious reasons, this frequently causes a great deal of emotional upset in the lab—not because the
research itself is of earth shattering importance but because the act raises the question of who really
owns the data and who has the right to control its dissemination.
The standard answer in academic research is that the University owns the data and the research
findings, but it is hard to convince an investigator of that when he or she is the one whose ideas
generated and whose work produced that data. So, what usually happens is that months of back and
forth communications go on, with the PI or the lab director trying to persuade the individual to return
his or her lab notebook, even though the University will often allow the individual to make and keep a
photocopy.
This kind of case always raises the following questions: Does the investigator have any right to
the ideas he or she developed while working at the lab? What considerations should this person make if
he tries to publish that data? How should such a situation be managed?","In his book Scientific Integrity, Francis Macrina notes that “Laboratory data books are the definitive
sources of data and facts.”1, p. 232
 He also points out that:
 An investigator who is taking over an ongoing project will naturally look to the lab notebooks for
definitive information on the experiments;
 The NIH can legally audit and examine data relevant to a grant it has awarded and might want to
inspect the source material;
 Data notebooks can be crucial sources of information to patent examiners, while litigation
involving patents might require the original data books for evidence.
There don’t appear to be any regulations for maintaining or managing the contents of laboratory
notebooks, so a great deal of variation can exist from lab to lab or institution to institution. This is
unfortunate because if universal standards existed that were robustly enforced—such as requiring all
investigators to update a master notebook maintained by the PI—the departure of a post-Doc such as
described in this scenario might not be all that traumatic. As it is, however, the post-Doc’s abrupt exit
with his (and, let us assume, others’) data might set the experiment or the entire research project back
considerably, possibly irreversibly. Furthermore, if the post-Doc leaves for another country, recovering
the data might be next to impossible.
While an investigator can insist that the data he generated in the lab is his by virtue of his labor,2
such stubborn insistence does not make the claim true. To the extent that a grant is made to an
institution by an external grantor like the NIH, the institution is the grantee, not its investigators. By
virtue of their employment, the investigators’ labors are purchased by the institution in return for which
the investigators perform the work promised in the grant.3
 Typically, the research will be carried out on
the institution’s premises with its technology, employees, and equipment—all of which underlines the
fact, made explicit in the grant award documentation as well as in the original employment contract or
letter of understanding between the institution and its investigators, that the institution owns the fruits
of its investigators’ labors. Usually, the only thing that will alter the institution’s ownership of data or its
intellectual property rights will be a 1) separate, legally enforceable contractual understanding with the
investigators such that they retain some portion of the intellectual property interest, or 2) an institution
might have a contractual understanding with a commercial grantor like a pharmaceutical company such
that the grantor will own the data. In this case, however, let us assume that the investigator’s abrupt 
departure with his lab notebook and other research data is a violation of his contractual obligation to
the institution and, therefore, minimally represents a theft. The question then becomes what is the
institution’s best course of action?
Certainly, the institution can sue the post-Doc, but if he has absconded with the materials to the
other side of the world, waging a lawsuit might be more trouble than it’s worth. We might turn the
question around, however, and ask “What can the post-Doc do with these data?” Suppose he tries to
publish them, but does not include any other investigators as authors even though he includes their
findings in the paper. If he publishes a paper with himself as sole author, he will then be taking credit
for certain work that is not his. This would constitute blatant misconduct, e.g., plagiarism, fraud,
misrepresentation, etc. Alternatively, if he attempts to contact other investigators and involve them in
writing the manuscript, they would be well advised to refuse co-operation until their institution is
satisfied that its intellectual property rights to these data are honored.
If the post-Doc totally refuses to co-operate but secures employment with another research
institution, the investigator’s former PI or lab director might contact the investigator’s new employer
and explain the situation. This might induce the new employer to correct the situation by imposing
pressure on the post-Doc to return the data. Alternatively, the threat of a well-publicized complaint
against the investigator and the damage it might do to his career might make him think hard about the
consequences of keeping the data. Of course, if the investigator’s new employer is as morally vacuous
as he is and values the data out of self-interest, that institution will similarly risk violating intellectual
property rights and invite patient infringement litigation should it pursue research using the pilfered
data.
Investigators at institutions must have a clear and explicit understanding of their contractual
obligations and the ownership status of the work products they evolve. To the extent that an employer
can show that a reasonable attempt was made to have employees gain a reasonable understanding of
who owns what—for example, was the explanation conveyed in the investigator’s native language?—
the investigator’s moral turpitude is all the more blatant and unjustified.
Ultimately, it is worth considering that the investigator might have his way about this, cause
profound damage to the institution he left, and not suffer much, if at all, by way of penalty. Regardless
of whether the investigator’s intentions were to sabotage the lab or steal the data for his personal gain,
or whether he just stubbornly believes that the data are his no matter what, the institution might decide
that the fight to have the data returned isn’t worth the effort. On the other hand, not prosecuting or
failing to lodge a professional complaint about the investigator’s conduct seems to condone it. Whether
the investigator did or did not remain in the United States, the institution would be remiss if it didn’t
inform the research entity at which this investigator might secure future employment of his data theft.
Alternatively, the institution might contact any professional organizations with which the investigator is
involved or is a member and inform them of the incident.
Perhaps the best, although not foolproof, way to protect against something like this happening
is for the PI to insist that the experiment’s master log or master notebook is updated regularly and that
all the investigators in the lab feel supported and respected. We do not know why this investigator left,
but if his departure was motivated by vengeance or hatred, supportive and respectful leadership and an
insistence on professionalism among the lab’s staff might have prevented it.","%Introduction:  
This dilemma centers on the ownership and control of research data when a post-doc leaves a lab with their lab notebook, raising significant ethical and legal questions about intellectual property rights in academic research.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the contractual obligations of researchers, the ownership of data generated during employment, the potential for misconduct if the data is published without proper attribution, and the emotional impact on the lab environment.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
The situation reflects broader issues in academic research regarding data ownership, as highlighted by Francis Macrina's emphasis on the importance of lab notebooks. The lack of universal standards for data management exacerbates these conflicts, while the legal framework surrounding grants and institutional ownership complicates individual claims to data.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
To address such situations, institutions should establish clear policies regarding data ownership and ensure that all researchers understand their contractual obligations. If a post-doc absconds with data, the institution may consider legal action, but also engage the new employer of the post-doc to rectify the situation. Additionally, maintaining a master notebook could mitigate future disputes.

%Key Takeaways:  
The ownership of research data is a complex issue that requires clear institutional policies and communication. Institutions must balance the need for accountability with the potential consequences of pursuing legal action, while fostering a supportive lab environment to prevent conflicts.","%Introduction:

13,"A number of fairly recent articles appearing in Nature and other journals over the last few years have
worried about the possibility of investigators’ manipulating images for publication. For example, in a
2006 on-line issue of Nature (at www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature04996.html) Dale
Benos noted that:
[D]igital image-processing programs make it a simple matter to prettify ugly gels. Unwanted
background, smudges and ‘non-specific’ bands can be easily removed from the final figure. I
have always thought that showing only a single band of interest in a figure such as a western
blot or immunoprecipitation experiment is a somewhat equivocal practice, although I admit I
have done it…If images are manipulated to enhance what we aim to demonstrate, even if our
intentions are good, we chip away at the integrity of the scientific enterprise and erase the trust
that the public places in our work.
So, are there any rules of thumb that investigators might use to distinguish allowable from unallowable
uses of image manipulaton? Or should only raw images be submitted to journal editors?","Obviously, digital images are data upon whose accuracy the scientific community depends. Just as the
data that appear in the tables of lab reports can be misrepresented or fabricated, so can digital imagery
data. A primary but not always realized source for misrepresenting digital imagery data consists in the
fact that each individual element of the image, called a pixel, has a numerical value reflecting an RGB
(red/green/blue) intensity. Image processing that alters that intensity can improve the visualization of
the data. But if that image alteration mischaracterizes the data, one has gone too far. “Honest” ethical
dilemmas lie in the gray zone between enhancing the image such that its clarity is improved (but its
perceived content has not essentially changed) versus enhancing the image such that it now suggests
what is, in reality, not there. So, for example, because software image filters change the numerical data
in the pixels, they can create image artifacts leading to misinterpretation. As such, they are usually not
recommended for biological images.
The resolution of dilemmas over whether or not an investigator has gone too far in manipulating
an image is very simple: The investigator should make an unaltered, raw image of the data and retain it,
preferably in the original file format. This image is never altered or enhanced; only its copies are. If the
investigator honestly believes that an altered version of the original image is preferable for publication,
he or she should attach both a copy of the original and the altered image to the manuscript being
submitted along with a detailed description of why and how the copied image was altered. The journal
editors can then decide which image to publish. If the altered image is chosen, the nature of the
alteration should be described in the figure legend and explained in the methodology section of the
paper. That way, both the investigator and the journal will maintain transparency so that no accusations
of deception or misrepresentation will stand. In a nutshell, that’s how to resolve this problem, when it is
provoked by honest consternation of whether or not some kind of image manipulation is allowable. The 
remainder of this opinion will discuss various technical details and considerations associated with digital
image manipulation that Cromey includes in his article.
Cromey begins his remarks with a reminder about the importance of safeguarding and protecting the
unaltered, original image because accusations of misconduct will stand or fall based on whether or not
the original is available to compare with its copies. Indeed, investigators whose work falls under the
FDA’s “Final Rule on Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures” must maintain the integrity of
the original image. Similarly, industries whose work products are used in forensic activities or in HIPAArelated aspects of health care might be required to maintain an original image.
Cromey suggests that adjustments to the original image that are usually acceptable are small
adjustments in brightness and contrast or reasonable adjustments of the levels and gamma settings.
Although cropping an image is usually acceptable, accusations of unethical cropping will occur when the
cropping distorts the image, e.g., cropping so as to omit something that contradicts the investigator’s
hypothesis. If cropping yields a special, “one of a kind” image rather than a representative picture, then
the cropping has been performed unethically. Sound guideline language is found in the Journal of Cell
Biology’s Instructions to Authors (2007) in that image adjustments must not “obscure, eliminate, or
misrepresent any information present in the original” and that the original itself must fairly represent
the reality of the image such that multiple micrographs can attest to the same empirical reality.
(Available at http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml). Cromey also makes the following
recommendations:
(1) Digital images that are to be compared to one another should be acquired under identical
processing considerations. If they are not, the reason should be explained in the publication or
in the figure legend.
(2) Enhancing a specific area of an image is extremely questionable. If performed, the selective
enhancement(s) must be identified and explained. Similarly, because they can create artifacts in
an image, the use of software filters that can lead to misinterpretation are questionable.
(3) Copying objects from one part of an image to another part is extremely problematic while “the
use of cloning techniques to create objects in an image that did not exist there originally (e.g.,
creating a new gel band) is completely unethical.”
(4) JPEG compression reduces the file size but it also changes the XY resolution of the image and the
intensity value of any given pixel. This kind of compression should be avoided and replaced by a
TIF file format.
(5) Care should be exercised when changing the pixel size of a digital image. Decreasing image size
will decrease the image’s resolution. Increasing image size can cause the software to “guess” at
how many pixels need to be created between the existing ones. If the total number of pixels in
an image is going to change because of a manipulation, it should be done only once to limit the
number of artifacts that might be introduced.
Cromey believes that investigators who overuse image editing such that it becomes morally problematic
probably do so from ignorance rather than malevolence. Nevertheless, we might end with Cromey’s
quoting this stern warning from the Journal of Cell Biology’s 2007 Instructions to Authors:
All digital images in manuscripts accepted for publication will be scrutinized by our production
department for any indication of improper manipulation. Questions raised by the production
department will be referred to the Editors, who will request the original data from the authors
for comparison to the prepared figures. If the original data cannot be produced, the acceptance
of the manuscript may be revoked. Cases of deliberate misrepresentation of data will result in 
revocation of acceptance, and will be reported to the corresponding author’s home institution
of funding agency. (Available at http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml)
Consequently, if moral arguments that discourage image misrepresentation don’t impress or persuade
the investigator bent on deception, perhaps the self-interest setbacks that await him or her upon being
found out will discourage the act.

14,"Labs A & B had been collaborating for some time, leading to a publication that appeared
in a very prestigious journal. Some months later, Mary, who is a researcher from Lab A,
visited Lab B to learn a technique used in the paper. While there, she became highly
suspicious of the technique that the lab technicians and researchers were using. When
she questioned them, they were very vague in their explanations and never really
showed her how to do the experiment that she visited to learn. When she returned and
reported all this to her PI, he decided to do an experiment on his own. Instead of
sending the next batch of dissolved protein to Lab B as it was expecting, Mary's PI sent
pure water. Lab B generated data from the water. Mary's PI then called the PI of Lab B,
who denied wrongdoing and broke off the collaboration. Mary's PI did not publicly
report the false data, however, for fear that the earlier paper the labs had co-authored
might be suspected of data manipulation.
The PI from Lab B was clearly in an ethical bind. On the one hand, it certainly
appeared he had an obligation to report falsified data. On the other, he has an
obligation to protect his lab's future. The retraction of a previously published paper in a
very high impact journal would put his career and the future of his and his collaborator's
labs in jeopardy. Indeed, the consequences of a blemish to one PI's ethical conduct
would affect everyone else in the labs as they attempt to procure future funding and
jobs.
My PI appeared to feel more obligated to protect his lab's interests since he was
not involved in any fabrication, and had no proof of wrongdoing related to the
published paper. Still, these kinds of instances are probably not all that uncommon,
leading one to wonder how much data fabrication and fraud exist in scientific literature.","This case offers the opportunity to examine how data manipulation or fabrication
relates to the moral significance of scientific research as well as to the obligation to
report suspicions of research misconduct.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Research Integrity (ORI), research misconduct is defined as the “fabrication, falsification,
or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research
results.” The fabrication of research data not only violates ORI mandates but is
unequivocally repudiated by most professional organizations as a violation of the most
basic ethical standards of research conduct. Caplan has remarked that individuals who
lie about research data suffer from a failure of morals, while Hofmann offers the
important insight that certain moral norms—particularly openness, honesty, and
truthfulness—are so important to the practice of scientific research, that their presence
or absence serves to distinguish between what can be considered science or non-science.
Because anyone can submit false or fabricated “data,” Hoffman argues that “(T)he
assessment of whether a work holds scientific quality appears to be less dependent on 
the results or consequences of a certain type of work, than on moral norms.” Telling
the truth, honestly reporting data, and not “creating” data are so morally fundamental
to the scientific enterprise that their absence contradicts the activity calling itself
“science.” The primacy of knowledge production is a fundamental element of science
that requires absolute faithfulness to honesty and truth telling.
In this case, the data submitted on the specimen of water may well have been
fabricated. Both PIs should at least be suspicious about the incident and, clearly, both
bear responsibility for managing it. But while it was certainly appropriate for the PI of
Lab A to report the findings to the PI of Lab B, now what? What about further reporting
this incident?
The Guidelines for Responsible Conduct of Research issued by ORI in January
2007 state the following:
 Reporting suspected research misconduct is a shared and serious responsibility
of all members of the academic community. Any person who suspects research
misconduct has an obligation to report the allegation to the dean of the unit in
which the suspected misconduct occurred or to the Research Integrity Officer.
Allegations are handled under procedures described in the University's Research
Integrity Policy. All reports are treated confidentially to the extent possible, and
no adverse action will be taken, either directly or indirectly, against a person
who makes such an allegation in good faith. Protection of whistleblowers against
retaliation is guaranteed under policies of both the University and the federal
and state governments.
The Research Integrity Officer must report findings of research
misconduct to the funding agency, and in some cases even an allegation must be
reported at some stage of the investigation. But even with this mandate on handling research misconduct, institutional policies can
vary widely, leaving the reporting of a particular incident of possible data fabrication like
the one described above subject to the interpretation of the particular institution’s
policies.
There seems to be clear evidence that researchers and institutions interpret this
mandate in a very narrow way, suggesting a severe under-reporting of misconduct. ORI
reports an average of 24 institutional investigational reports on research misconduct per
year. However, in 2006 ORI surveyed researchers about their own observations of
misconduct over a 3 year period. They concluded that a very conservative estimate of
observed possible research misconduct could be as high as 2,325 incidents per year,
almost 100 times the actual rate of reported investigations.
In analyzing why there is so much under-reporting, ORI identified a multitude of
institution-wide circumstances and recommended a number of strategies including a
zero tolerance for misconduct, protecting whistleblowers, defining clear mechanisms for
reporting misconduct, better training of mentors, identifying alternative mechanisms to
review and evaluate research misconduct, and modeling of ethical behavior.
In the above case, the ethical response would be to report it. A reasonable
approach would be for the PI in Lab A (which received the faulty data) to report this 
directly to his compliance officer. Most likely, the compliance officer would then
contact the appropriate official responsible for Lab B, assuming Lab B is at another
institution. That officer would investigate the current complaint and could decide to
more broadly investigate other data generated by Lab B. While this may culminate in a
formal investigation and perhaps call into question the data reported in the previously
published paper, the PI from Lab A has positioned himself on the moral high ground
rather than in an overt or covert cover-up. Indeed, looking to more practical
considerations, many scientific fields are so competitive that incorrect or falsified data
are readily identified by competitors. To the extent that it is discovered that the PIs
remained mum about the possibility of fabricated data, both their reputations may be
sullied.
As a final note, one wonders if there shouldn’t be an “intermediary” stage of
investigation somewhere between the two PIs and a Research Integrity Office (RIO).
Notice that the clinical environment has such an intermediate stage in the form of the
“incident” report that goes to risk management. Risk management, which strongly
encourages a nonpunitive/blameless posture, then investigates the claim with a view to
targeting those system weaknesses that contribute to or facilitate the incident and that
need repair. But such a more benign sounding intermediary doesn’t seem to exist in a
research environment. One simply takes one’s suspicions to the RIO, whose title
conjures up a ruthless instrument of justice. Of course, the two entities would be rather
different in that clinical/risk management scenarios typically witness no intentional
misconduct, insurance coverage exists for negligences, and so forth, while in the
research analogue we are envisioning, one might see intentional falsification, no
insurance coverage, reputation at serious risk, and so on. So, perhaps the research
intermediary we are proposing could be tried on a pilot basis and “choreographed” with
a view to providing as much support to those involved as possible. As it currently exists
in suspicions about research misconduct, if one wonders why such suspicions remain
under an institution’s official moral radar screen, the fear inducing nature of the RIO
may be an answer.
Summary: Any fabrication of data is research misconduct and seriously undermines the
basic integrity of science and scientific research. As such it is never acceptable.
Responsible conduct of research requires that incidents of suspected fabrication of data
be reported so that an appropriate investigation can be conducted and actions to
correct the data and prevent further misconduct needed to assure integrity is
maintained. This will take institutional support for a culture of integrity as well as
appropriate actions on the part of the individual researcher.

15,"I recall an uncomfortable period in a lab where I worked a few years ago. The lab was
productive, and the personnel worked reasonably well together. We had a number of very
intelligent and hard-working investigators who were trained in foreign countries—some of
them with MDs—but their English writing skills were poor. Nevertheless, these individuals
conceived the experimental designs of their projects and collected and interpreted the data.
Somehow, though, they managed to get the project’s PI to write their papers entirely, but with
them as first, second, etc., authors and with the PI as last.
The PI was comfortable with this arrangement. The problem arose when a postdoc was
asked to write these investigators’ papers. She didn’t like the arrangement one bit. As far as
she was concerned, she hadn’t participated in the investigators’ research and so shouldn’t be
writing their papers. And even if she had participated to some extent, she felt that writing their
papers entirely by herself was unreasonably time-consuming. Furthermore, she argued that if
she would write such a paper entirely by herself, then she deserved first authorship, regardless
of the amount of work she devoted to the project itself.
A sort of truce was reached when the postdoc let everyone know that if she became
more involved in the investigators’ research from the beginning, she would be willing to do the
writing if they did most of the data gathering. She still objected, though, to the investigators
being listed as first authors without their writing or editing anything. But she compromised on
a number of occasions to maintain peace and productivity.
Sometime later, both she and I left the lab. I’ve often wondered whether this situation
continued. Please comment. ","This scenario raises the interesting problem of the putative difference between “writing” a
paper—where one effortfully translates his or her thoughts into some form of symbolic
notation like words or images—versus “authoring” a paper where the “ideas” might be the
author’s but the words that ultimately appear in print could be those of someone else, like a
ghostwriter. Obviously, most authors are also writers: They fashion words of their own
choosing into sentences, paragraphs, articles, books, etc. But is it necessarily the case that all
writers are also authors? Setting words to paper doesn’t necessarily constitute “authorship” as
in the case of those saintly medieval monks laboring for years in their monasteries’ scriptoria
copying manuscripts. Alternatively, what should we say about a pharmaceutical company’s
ghostwriter, who interviews a researcher, learns the researcher’s methods and findings, and
then writes a paper which the researcher reads, approves, and claims authorship of? Is this
unethical if, in fact, the researcher did all the work but had the ghostwriter write the paper? If
it is unethical, then what are we to say about a sizeable portion of many law review articles as
well as appellate and (virtually all) Supreme Court decisions that are mostly written by law
students and clerks, who are never cited as authors? (Nor, for that matter, are Presidential
speechwriters.)
To gain further appreciation of this problem, the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors guidelines are maddeningly vague as to whether or not an author of a scientific
article must actually “write” any of it. The (notorious) section of the guidelines states that:
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and
design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and 3) final approval of
the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2 and 3.1
Note that these stipulations do not explicitly state that authors must actually, i.e., physically,
write the paper’s sentences as they appear in final manuscript form. While the first author
might have conceived and refined the research idea and methodology, collected and
interpreted the data, and finally contemplated its meaning, the articulation of these activities
into symbolic language that takes the ultimate form of a manuscript might be some other,
anonymous person’s doing. Indeed, one suspects that this has happened often in the history of
scientific publication.
Something like this is going on in the above scenario. The investigators have been
spoiled by their remarkably benevolent PI’s writing their papers. The new postdoc, however,
objects to writing their papers because “She hadn’t participated in the investigators’ research.”
Certainly, the postdoc’s objection is on strong grounds. It seems a very poor use of her time to
ask her to write another group’s papers, whose research she hadn’t participated in. Indeed,
one might argue that even if she did write the papers she could not ethically claim any kind of
authorship credit because, by her own admission, she did none of the research. The postdoc’s
contention that “if she wrote a paper entirely, she deserved first authorship” is entirely
incorrect according to the ICMJE guidelines if she did none of the research. On that basis, she is
simply recording someone else’s ideas, activities, and findings.
But does this analysis do an injustice to the postdoc’s actual activity in writing the
investigators’ papers? Is she simply “recording” that group’s work? Or is she instead having to
exercise a great deal of creative and intellectual work in drafting the paper, performing the
literature review, producing a finely tuned description of the research methodology, deciding
how to present the data in the most compelling fashion, and imaginatively considering what the
findings imply? If this latter description better captures the postdoc’s efforts—indeed,
anyone’s efforts who is put in her position—it is no wonder that she was upset at being placed
well down the authorship list, as she clearly was making a “significant intellectual contribution.”
The solution that was finally adopted by way of the postdoc’s becoming involved in the
group’s research from the start isn’t bad, but it leaves unanswered the perhaps unanswerable
question of precisely discerning and measuring one’s “intellectual contribution” to a paper so
as to allocate authorship status fairly. Even as the postdoc is now “more involved in the
investigators’ research from the beginning,” and even though she continues to write the
papers, her claim to first or even second authorship isn’t a foregone conclusion. First
authorship should still be a function of how the variables of “significant intellectual
contribution” as they are listed above play out.
As we have noted in previous case scenarios—see, for example, the cases “A Mess of
Authors,” “Deciding First Authorship,” and “The Tyrannical Principal Investigator” at
http://www.actsi.org/areas/erks/ethics/authorship.html.—an early negotiation that decides
the authorship order cannot be overemphasized. But in cases like the one above, we 
recommend the following prophylactic strategy: Insist that the investigators compose the first
draft of the manuscript. Surely, this would count as an unassailable intellectual contribution,
no matter how imperfect their language or syntax. Once composed, their rough draft can then
be handed over to someone else. If that person is the postdoc who is already involved in the
research and who has therefore already made an intellectual contribution, one would think her
additional effort in bringing the manuscript to a final form would argue strongly for her as first
author. But what if the paper were handed over to a ghostwriter?
If the ghostwriter plays only an editorial role, then he or she doesn’t deserve an
authorship credit. (Incidentally, neither does the PI who originally wrote the papers if he
played no substantive role in the research activity.) What can be done, however, is to cite the
ghostwriter’s editorial contribution as an acknowledgement, perhaps at the end of the paper.
For its part, research universities that have significant numbers of personnel doing
intellectual work but whose English composition skills are substandard might consider having
those employees enroll in English language proficiency programs from the very start.
Nevertheless, we shall end with the moral reminder that authors are authors because they
make “intellectual” contributions to the work. The ambiguity of that term, however, will
doubtlessly account for dilemmas like the one above surfacing occasionally and requiring
careful consideration. ","%Introduction:

16,"This dilemma occurred some years ago when I was in high school. I was taking a biology course
from a teacher I greatly respected. He was passionate about his subject; he took pains to teach
it well; and I was doing well in the class.
Toward the end of the year, however, I became distressed over an upcoming project
that would involve a dissection. While I will not argue about the pros and cons of animal
experimentation, I felt then (and still do) that gathering up thousands of frogs, cats, fetal pigs,
etc. for high school students (many of whom will go to college and study history or interior
design) is simply a gross waste of life. At the very least, I believe that an honest conscientious
objection such as mine constituted a reasonable justification for the teacher's assigning a
substitute activity for the dissection project.
To say he disagreed with me would be putting it mildly. He was insistent that dissection
was a mandatory part of the class and that if I refused to participate, my current grade of A
would become a C. He also informed me that he was under no obligation from the school to
accommodate me or my objections, claiming that ""morals have no place in my classroom.""
Fortunately, the school administrators were more understanding, once my irate mother
called. They insisted that my teacher would have to prepare an alternative assignment for me
or any other student who did not wish to participate in the dissection. He went along, but only
after telling me he was doing so against his will. I also remember a remarkable threat: that if
he so much as caught me or any other dissenter wearing a leather belt, he would fail us.
Ultimately, two other students and I completed the alternative assignment—which was
more than twice the workload of the dissection project—and I kept my A for the course. But
my relationship with the teacher was never the same. I could no longer respect him as I once
had. I felt he had ignored my values and my rights and had only yielded from force and with
bitterness.
On the other hand, a dilemma like mine raises the larger question about the limits of
conscientious objection among science students. Suppose a student refuses to do an
assignment because he (or his parents) objects to certain anatomical drawings in his textbook,
or that he does not wish to participate in classes on reproduction, or learning about the
construction of the atomic bomb? How might one discriminate between ethically reasonable
versus unreasonable objections to certain material in science curricula?","In some states, students enjoy a legal right to exemption from animal dissection exercises under state statutory law or administrative policy. Resources for students and their parents regarding legal rights to exemption are available from the Humane Society of the United States1 and the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Assuming students do not enjoy a legal right to exemption, how should teachers and school administrators respond to the ethical issues posed by the dilemma contributor? Two options are considered here: eliminating animal dissection exercises from K-12 science curricula altogether or continuing the use of these exercises but granting exemptions to conscientious objectors. Elimination of Animal Dissection Exercises Assuming that, as a matter of biological-scientific literacy, school children ought to acquire basic knowledge about animal anatomy, can and should the mode of instruction be revised to eliminate animal dissection exercises and employ alternatives? Effective and affordable alternatives are increasingly available. These include charts, slides, dissection manuals, 3D models, simulators, manikins, preserved materials, computer emulations and simulations, films, photographs, video, interactive video, Internet presentations, and virtual simulators.3 Employing these alternatives would sacrifice some depth of knowledge that can only be attained by animal dissection.4 But, if there are ethical concerns associated with the “transportation, holding, and killing” of “six million vertebrates” per year in the U.S, as estimated in 2004 for use in animal dissection exercises,5 should we consider substituting good if not perfect alternatives? In a diverse society, we will disagree about the moral significance of harm to animals and the weight it should be given in our analysis. But even as the debate persists, our laws, policies, and practices indicate broad acknowledgement across diverse worldviews that harm to animals is morally significant, can be justified only for worthy purposes, and should be minimized. For example, while most of us continue to use animals for food and clothing, laws and polices prohibit pointless acts of animal cruelty and neglect and regulate the use of animals in research. Current regulations governing animal research aim to ensure that animals are used only for worthwhile purposes; measures are undertaken to minimize suffering, imposition on quality of life, and premature loss of life; and consideration is given to methods that can accomplish the research goals without the use of animals.6 Given currently available alternatives to teaching students the basics of animal anatomy and given the moral significance and extent of the harm to animals caused by current practices, there is reason to consider whether we should eliminate animal dissection exercises in some school science curricula. If we cannot justify the use in light of the pedagogic purposes of the exercises, then continued use would amount to a “gross waste of life.” Exemption from Animal Dissection Exercises The dilemma contributor obviously believes that his or her right to adhere to his or her values should have been honored, willingly and respectfully. But the contributor recognizes that students in a diverse society hold diverse values and puzzles about how we might distinguish “ethically reasonable” from “ethically unreasonable” objections. The ethical questions surrounding conscience claims involve a tension between the scope of individual liberty when motivated by conscience and the scope of authority of those institutions that make it possible for diverse individuals to live together in peace, flourish, and enjoy a maximum range of liberty. The questioner claimed and eventually was granted an “ethical right” to conscientious exemption. But the questioner anticipates the resulting chaos if all members of a diverse student body could claim conscientious exemption from any and all science curricular requirements. So, how might we distinguish “reasonable” from “unreasonable” claims? We must resolve the tension between 1) the scope of individual liberty motivated by conscience and 2) the scope of institutional authority necessary to bind together a diverse community so that its members can live in peace, flourish, and enjoy a maximum range of liberty. When a claim for exemption is based on dissenting beliefs that are widely held and the exemption would not undermine the purposes of the curricular requirement, granting the exemption is a sensible, practical way to resolve the tension. For example, state legislatures have granted exemptions for underage use of wine as a sacrament in violation of state laws prohibiting underage drinking; the sacramental use of wine is widely engaged in and the practice does not implicate the health and safety concerns underlying underage drinking laws. Even if dissenting beliefs are not widely held, if compliance with the curricular requirement would substantially burden the student’s conscience and exemption would not undermine the purposes of the curricular requirement, granting the exemption also makes sense given the serious harm to individual conscience entailed in enforcing the requirement. So, for example, state legislatures have also granted exemptions for the sacramental use of peyote even though only a very few religious believers engage in this practice and given that sacramental use does not implicate the health and safety concerns underlying criminal prohibitions of peyote. In the dilemma contributor’s case, engaging in an exercise that would contribute to a “gross waste of life” would likely impose a substantial burden on the contributor’s conscience. This would seem to justify an “ethical right” to exemption given the ready availability of goodenough alternatives. Also, in light of the current-day availability of alternatives, widespread requests for exemption by students who object because they find dissecting animals to be repulsive—even if they cannot explain how engaging in the exercise would substantially burden their conscience—might be warranted as well. Doing so would avoid the practical difficulties of enforcing a requirement that is widely objected to and would grant that repulsion is sometimes, although not always, a marker of moral discomfort even if the person experiencing the repulsion cannot immediately articulate the moral objection. So, if biology teachers continue to require animal dissection exercises because they believe the pedagogic benefits justify the use of animals in this way, it would make sense to tell students at the outset of the animal anatomy portion of a course that the teacher believes that these dissection exercises are the best way to learn the material and to explain how the animals used in the exercise have been procured to answer any concerns students might have, for example, about the treatment of the animals in transportation or their preparation for use in dissection. The teacher could then add that students are entitled to perform alternative assignments if they find the exercises offensive or in violation of their moral beliefs. The Ethics of Other Conscientious Exemptions In some cases, as with animal dissection exercises, conscientious objectors will claim exemption from the mode of teaching truths about the natural world. In other cases, they may claim exemption from exposure to the content of these truths. The fundamental tension between the scope of individual conscience and of institutional authority is implicated in both cases, but the latter poses more difficult challenges to the ethical framework for resolving this tension because, if the exemptions are granted, the objectors might not realize some or all of the pedagogic purposes of the curricular requirements. Exposure to human anatomical drawings or instruction in the biology of human reproduction without explanation of the significance of sexual behavior in a religious context might substantially burden the conscience of some. In both of these examples, the objection is partly to mode and partly to content. So some of the pedagogic purposes of the curricular requirements might be met by alternative modes of instruction, for example, descriptions rather than depictions of anatomy or the substitution of instruction in reproduction in the home or a religious institution. With respect to learning about the construction of the atomic bomb, the objection would run almost entirely to content. Instruction in the content might substantially burden the conscience of those who believe it is unethical to teach truths when knowledge of these truths has in the past and might in the future contribute to consequences that the objector believes are profoundly immoral. Alternatives for the objector might require substitution of different content, for example, a historical account of a different scientific and engineering feat. At least in the case of requirements that would impose a substantial burden, given the corrosiveness to the educational experience of compelled compliance, exemptions might be granted even if realization of the pedagogical purpose for the objectors can only be partly achieved. This approach to determining the reasonableness of claimed ethical rights to exemption would seem especially important in the public school setting. If rights to exemption are not honored in public schools, this may increasingly drive individuals to private schools in which worldviews are shared and conflicts are unlikely to arise. Honoring these rights in public schools preserves the possibility of an educational meeting place for students with diverse worldviews, where teachers and learners can model reasonable accommodation of conscientious objectors, and where objections, such as those of the questioner, might prove to be the leading edge of revising prevailing views of how science should be taught.
Summary: ""Oftentimes, ethical dilemmas require numerous inputs and creative ideas
that exceed what one or two people can conjure up. Labs should be encouraged to
think and brainstorm collectively about the ethical dilemmas that occur among
researchers since, even if a satisfying resolution remains elusive, the fact that a serious,
collective attempt is made might relieve some of the moral distress that a dilemma like
this can cause.""","%Introduction:

17,"Some years ago, while I was still an undergraduate, I worked in a lab that did research
on topics pertaining to cardiothoracic surgery. Most of the projects in the lab used
animal subjects.
Our project required us to put mice to sleep by injecting chemicals, and then
cannulating their hearts while the hearts were still beating. This was quite difficult
because their aortas are very tiny and it was hard to insert the cannula without
puncturing the vessel. Initially, the plan was to perfect the cannulation procedure on
normal mice, and then perform the procedure on genetically mutant mice that would be
provided to us by collaborators.
In retrospect, neither the other student nor myself had the experience to be able
to perform this intricate surgical procedure. We ended up sacrificing many mice,
without ever being able to establish a working model. I believe we sacrificed these mice
needlessly due to our inexperience and, in fact, the inexperience of our research team.
Ironically, a week after we stopped doing the procedure, a surgical fellow visiting from a
foreign country took over the project and after sacrificing only a few mice was able to
develop a working model within a week.
It might be expected that researchers become desensitized given the frequency
with which animals are sacrificed for experiments, but I continue to feel poorly about
the unnecessary sacrifice and suffering of animals.
What kinds of ethical recommendations might this situation invite in order to
diminish harm to laboratory animals?","Russell and Burch’s classic 1959 text, The Principles of Humane Experimental
Technique, offered the “3Rs”—replace, reduce, refine—to guide ethical sensibilities
about animal use in research. Continuing today as a popular moral reference on the
ethical use of animals, the 3Rs recommend that researchers 1) replace methods that use
animals with those that do not (assuming that research findings or extrapolations are
not compromised by the replacement), 2) reduce the number of animals used (such as
laboratories coordinating their sharing laboratory animals, or taking multiple tissues
simultaneously from a single animal), and 3) refine existing procedures such that
animals experience less pain and distress (e.g., by administering tranquilizers or
analgesics).
The professional distress the researcher relates in this dilemma seems
appropriate since the scenario involves a situation where animals might indeed have
been needlessly sacrificed. Perhaps much of the dilemma could have been eliminated if
the researcher and his or her colleagues had, very early on, called the lab’s attention to
their difficulties in evolving a cannulation model. Doing so might have induced a
collective anxiety that could have resulted in some creative ideas from other laboratory
personnel to contain the problem. The researcher does mention, however, that the 
entire research team was inexperienced in the methodology, which suggests that a
collective realization of the same might have stimulated a search for a remediative
strategy sooner rather than later. In fact, it seems entirely fair to ask whether this
experiment should have even been launched, given the way the absent skill set
compromised the ethical use of laboratory animals.
Clearly, the skill set that the researchers lacked was obviously within reach if the
surgical fellow had little difficulty in evolving a model. Their problem was a lack of
awareness that, combined with a lack of support or advice regarding a model, might
have made the actual number of mice that were sacrificed seem inordinately large
(when the actual number might have been small). This case clearly posed the
psychological challenge to the investigator to become callous to the death of an animal
for the sake of the investigator’s advantage (career advancement, publications, etc.).
This is an important reality that keeps many wonderful people out of research biology
and/or directs them to studies involving tissue culture, etc. It can feel as though with
each animal carcass tossed in the animal bag, one is also tossing a bit of one’s soul or
spirit away. If the sacrifice ultimately led to generalizable data, then the animal deaths
might not have been in vain; but animal deaths that have no good outcome whatsoever
can hurt. The toxic effect of this experiment was not only on the mice but on the
investigator as well.
In any event, let us assume for the sake of argument that a “replacement”
approach, where the study could have been completed without laboratory animals, was
not feasible. Still, artificial mouse models constructed from laminate, vinyl, or latex
might have been available to afford practice opportunities. Also, the researchers could
have conducted a literature or computer search to determine if a cannulation model
was already discovered and described.
Indeed, they could have shared their problem with other labs in the interest of
locating one where cannulation training might be available and then visit that site and
be adequately trained. Quite possibly, the costs involved in such training would be
justified by the acquisition of the skill set, the opportunity of the researchers to teach it
to their peers, and whatever further benefits per future experiments might accrue with
duly trained personnel.
Even if that option was unavailable, however, the researchers might have
“scavenged” from other labs. They could have practiced on cadaveric mice or thoracic
sections from already sacrificed ones. Although perhaps unavailable when this dilemma
occurred, virtual reality training devices have come on the market, such as the P.O.P.
Simulator, which can be used for training in laparoscopic surgery.
Ultimately, the ethically beleaguered researchers seemed handicapped by
insufficient support that could have at least identified some possibilities whereby the
number of animals used in the project could have been reduced. Had they contacted
their Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), sage advice might have
been available. It might be worth pointing out, however, that the researcher’s
remarking about the mice “suffering” is arguable. To the extent that proper anesthesia
was used, there was little if any suffering. On the other hand, the needless use of 
animals is not only a waste of resources but deprives animals of their natural interest in
maintaining their welfare and self-preservation.","%Introduction:

18,"I worked with Dr. Z on data analysis that led to my writing a manuscript draft. Dr. Z
assisted with the data analysis but did not own the data and would not be senior author.
Upon reading my manuscript, Dr. Z said it was not acceptable for publication,
whereupon we then worked on it for 6 months. During that time, I would email him
revisions, which would come back with “not good enough” remarks, but little direction
for revision. When I evinced my frustration, he would say we were nearly done and I
just needed to work a little harder to complete it.
At the end of the 6 months, I decided I would leave Dr. Z’s lab. Dr. Z did not take
this at all kindly. In fact, he said some rather unflattering things about my work, and
stated that he wanted to submit the paper himself as first author and not even include
me as an author.
My new lab director Dr. N, who did own the data and to my mind had a clear
claim to being first author from the start, informed me about what Dr. Z was saying. Dr.
N said he felt I had the right to submit the paper myself and that we could remove Dr. Z
completely from authorship—which confused me even more. I wasn’t comfortable
going behind Dr. Z’s back, especially as he had originally made numerous suggestions
affecting the project’s design. But clearly, Dr. Z and Dr. N were at odds and I felt I could
easily get caught in their crossfire.
The primary question I was left with was how to sort this authorship mess out.
Dr. Z, in my mind, certainly deserved some authorship credit, but my current advisor
was disagreeing. Also, he insisted that I be first author, which was flattering but, I
thought, somewhat undeserved. As it turned out, the paper was never submitted. I feel
badly that it wasn’t. How could this mess have been worked out?","So, the projected paper never gets published, perhaps owing to the collapse of what
might be called “research virtues.” In their book, Responsible Conduct of Research,
Shamoo and Resnick offer the following as a kind of Aristotelian list of traits and
practices that are conducive to good research and as well as productive research
relationships
:
* Honesty * Openness * Freedom
* Objectivity * Confidentiality * Social Responsibility
* Integrity * Respect for Colleagues * Efficiency
* Carefulness * Respect for Intellectual Property * Education
 * Competence * Equality of Opportunity * Legality
 * Animal Care * Human Subjects Protection
Dr. Z and Dr. N appear very much to lack collegial respect, respect for intellectual
property, and objectivity. Furthermore, as the troubles start from Dr. Z’s consistent
rejections of the student’s revisions, accompanied by his failure to supply concrete,
constructive criticism, we might fault Dr. Z’s educative or mentoring style for leaving the 
student in the dark—a problem, it seems worth noting, that is not unknown in graduate
studies.
Once the student decides to quit Dr. Z’s lab and move to Dr. N’s, professorial
egoism seems to take over on both sides. We assume that Dr. Z is insulted by the move
and seeks to discredit the student’s claim to authorship. Dr. N on the other hand
suggests discrediting Dr. Z’s contributions entirely and having the student be first
author. No wonder the student is bewildered: Neither Dr. Z nor Dr. N appear to be
acting ethically or professionally but rather to be venting their spleens at one another
and dismissing customary rules of authorship.
Obviously, collaboration is essential in research and as Shamoo and Resnick
point out—although it is certainly a matter of common sense as well—there can be no
collaboration without trust, respect, integrity and collegiality. Drs. Z and N are hardly
setting a positive example.
While it is easy to imagine this clash of personalities occurring in a commercial
research lab, it is hard to imagine that it would result in the ultimate deliverable, i.e., a
decent manuscript, never seeing the light of publication. Management in industry
would doubtlessly have some sort of supervisory mechanism that would not have
allowed all this work to go for naught. What seems to be seriously lacking in this case is
an institutional mechanism that would not only recognize everyone’s contribution to
the work, but that would assist Dr. Z and Dr. N to work more collegially.
One wonders if the student had a mentor to whom he could have gone when he
started experiencing “issues” with Dr. Z. Was Dr. N his mentor? If so, then Dr. N could
have exerted some positive leadership but didn’t. Although it is a bit unclear—what was
the student doing with Dr. N’s data, working with Dr. Z in Dr. Z’s lab?—Dr. N seems to
lead the project, so he should have been made aware of what was going on between
the student and Dr. Z and have acted to attend to their communication problem. One
also worries that this is probably not the first time Dr. Z was vague in giving directions
and slowed a student’s professional momentum. (And Dr. Z needs to know about that.)
Perhaps this case is valuable in its illustrating what happens when professorial
narcissism or egoism trumps the kinds of virtues that Shamoo and Resnick encourage.
Of course, human beings will come to disagree with one another, but it is lamentable
that they cannot agree to disagree agreeably.
In summary, to have averted these problem, the following might have worked:
Dr. Z should have been more thoughtful and explicit in advising the student. It
would probably have taken Dr. Z only a few minutes to jot down some concrete
suggestions to the student every time an issue arose, rather than leave the
student to guess the intent of Dr. Z’s vague and imprecise suggestions (maybe
“musings” or “meanderings” are better words). This is a very serious failing on
Dr. Z’s part because it not only causes considerable consternation and anxiety on
the student’s part, but stymies the creative process, delays the project, and
slows the student’s career momentum.
The student should have felt comfortable in approaching Dr. Z and frankly
discussing his quandary, which Dr. Z should have taken to heart. Instead, the 
student and Dr. Z go limply back and forth for 6 months, until the student
decides to throw in the towel and move to Dr. N’s lab.
It is lamentable that the student felt he had to leave Dr. Z’s lab. Had there been
a mechanism in place to address the problems mentioned above, this might not
have had to happen. Where was the student’s advisor during all this? Was there
even one in place?
Upon coming to Dr. N’s lab, virtues like respect for colleagues and respect for
intellectual property should have held sway, rather than the acrimony that the
student describes. Dr. N should have sat down with Dr. Z to negotiate their
authorship arrangements in a professional way. The idea of neither Dr. Z nor the
student having authorship seems patently unjust to both.
The paper is never written because the principals didn’t try hard enough to
respect one another and set aside their differences. Perhaps there was an
institutional remedy—going to the lab director, section head, departmental
chair, dean, etc., but it was apparently refused.
In the end, one feels badly for the student as well as for science and the toil that goes
into. Surely the student was entitled to a professionally positive experience which,
given the likes of Dr. N and Z, didn’t happen. Just so, the student was entitled to the
recognition his work deserved, which failed to materialize as well. Thus, this case is a
good example of how a failure in professional comportment or relational behaviors can
spoil the interests of science and the educational process.

19,"My principal investigator (PI) was preparing a manuscript for publication and had
planned to submit it to a high impact journal. After people in the department were
made aware of the project and of its novelty, it was thought that the manuscript would
likely be accepted.
At that point, my PI was approached by numerous clinicians and postdocs
claiming that they had contributed significantly to this work and should be considered
manuscript authors. Having worked closely with the first author of the project, granting
authorship to these presumptive authors struck me as ridiculous. One of them claimed
authorship because he had provided a common dye reagent. Another, whom we hardly
ever saw in our lab, claimed it was his idea to do certain experiments that were
published in the manuscript—a claim that no one could remember. And there were
others.
Although my PI knew these authorship demands were unfounded, he clearly felt
pressure as a nontenured faculty member to cooperate with certain postdocs because
they had worked in highly productive labs of prominent tenured researchers, and my PI
did not want to sour those relationships. Ultimately, there were a lot of backroom
negotiations and discussions and two additional authors were added to the manuscript.
In my opinion, however, they had contributed nothing to the manuscript.
The paper was eventually accepted in a very influential journal. So it was quite
ironic to have our Medical School, a few months later, publish an editorial chastising the
increasing number of ""phantom"" authors on papers that were being published by the
School's researchers.","Anyone who has been in a research environment for more than a year has probably
observed or been involved in some sort of authorship dispute. As academic ‘currency,’
authorship is the way credit is assigned. It has become the primary way researchers are
judged and careers are made. A major contribution (often indicated by first or last
authorship) on an important paper (as rated by colleagues in the field) in a high–impact
journal (as measured by citation rates) can have a significant and lasting effect on a
person’s career. It is no wonder that one of the first things budding scientists learn is
“publish or perish.”
Given the importance we have assigned to authorship, many researchers feel
pressure to make sure their name appears on as many papers as possible. But being
listed as an author on a paper without having made a significant contribution to the
work does a disservice to the field, to the general scientific community, and to the
public.
To combat ‘phantom’ or ‘ghost’ authorship, the International Committee of
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) prepared “Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts 
Submitted to Biomedical Journals.”1
 In the document, the ICMJE recommends explicit
and stringent criteria for bestowing authorship, including
• Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions
to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and
interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically
for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the
version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to
take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.
The ICMJE recommendations are not binding, so journals have established their own
guidelines for determining who should be an author, Some, like the Journal of the
American Medical Association2
, have adopted the ICMJE guidelines and require each
author to indicate what her contribution was to the work. Others, like Nature3
, Science4
,
and Cell5
, simply remind corresponding authors of the responsibilities of submission and
dispute resolution. But the adoption of guidelines does not guarantee their use or
enforcement. So what is an ethical scientist to do?
 Read the authorship guidelines for the journal to which you plan to submit
your manuscript. Read the guidelines for all the journals in your fields. Talk
about them with you colleagues.
 Talk early and often about authorship of your future papers. When you first
plan a research path, talk about who the authors might be. Revisit that
conversation frequently as your research progresses.
 Model good behavior. This is particularly important for deans, department
chairs and other influential researchers who help set the standards of
behavior for the scientific community. The “top-down” approach helps
protect junior professors who may not want to risk their careers by refusing
ghost authorship.
 Remember that authorship is a responsibility. This responsibility applies
when credit is given for good work, when explanations about the work are
needed, and when blame is assigned for inaccurate or unethical work.
Authors should be prepared to accept responsibility for the work under all
these circumstances.
Regarding the above scenario, the ICMJE guidelines explicitly state that “Acquisition of
funding, collecting of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not
justify authorship.” 1
Thus, the time-honored practices of bestowing authorship simply
because so-and-so is the lab director, or has supplied a reagent, or is a noted authority
in the field whose name as an author might accelerate acceptance of the article are
unethical. Authors must make a “substantive intellectual contribution” to the article 
and either drafted or revised it. Otherwise, their contribution might be acknowledged
at the end of the article, but it does not qualify them as authors.
Finally, consider the case of Gerald Schatten, a University of Pittsburgh
professor. He was a senior author on a 2005 Science paper from the lab of Hwang WooSuk, a stem cell researcher, who was later shown to have fabricated much of his
published data. According to the San Francisco Gate, “Schatten did not contribute to
the science but was listed as senior author and shared in the ensuing fame for serving as
an ‘adviser’… He recently tried to extricate himself from the disaster by asking Science to
take his name off the paper. Science declined, saying that senior authors have a
responsibility to know what is going on","%Introduction:

20,"This situation occurred shortly after I finished my master’s degree, when I decided to move to
another lab to begin my doctoral work. I chose Dr. Jenkins’s lab because of his well-known
expertise in an area of pharmacokinetics in which I wanted to concentrate my career.
A few weeks after joining the lab, I thought I had made a mistake because I began
feeling somewhat uncomfortable around him. He seemed overly nice and helpful to me, and
he was always trying to be charming and funny. These behaviors struck me as clumsy and
offputting, but in the two years I worked in his lab, he never made any romantic advances or
overtures. Fortunately, as the months went on, I began feeling somewhat more comfortable
around him, and I think he did around me.
The ethical incident that still bothers me involved a small grant that the lab got from a
pharmaceutical company to generate some data on a compound that was of particular interest
to Dr. Jenkins and me. It was agreed and contractually understood that our first manuscript
would be published in one of the pharmaceutical company’s publications rather than a peerreviewed journal. We worked together on the project. While I was in charge of most of the
data generation and interpretation, Dr. Jenkins also ran some experiments and contributed. Or
at least he seemed to. The problem was that by the time I got to the lab later on in the
morning, he had already been there for several hours and he’d give me his data and lab notes.
At the end of a few months, we had generated enough findings to justify our writing the paper,
which we did. And that’s when the surprise came.
As we were adding some finishing touches, Dr. Jenkins said to me, “Mary, I’ve been very
impressed with how you’ve done the lion’s share of this project, so I want you to be the sole
author of this paper. It will be good for your career. I don’t need this publication, but it will
look good on your CV, especially with you as sole author. So, it’s yours. And don’t say I never
gave you anything, ha, ha, ha.”
At first I was really thrilled about this. The only other publication I had was one where I
was included with about a dozen other authors, and I was number 8 or 9 on the author list. I
thought this opportunity would be really cool.
But then I began having second thoughts. Mostly, they involved the fact that I would be
taking credit, as the sole author, for data that I didn’t generate. Would that be a
misrepresentation? Also, Dr. Jenkins from time to time made a suggestion for a modest change
in this or that—which we duly noted in our records and reported to the pharmaceutical
company—and that was fine. But those were his ideas that we incorporated into the protocol,
not mine. Yet, as sole author, I would be taking credit for the whole thing.
As it happened, we did submit the paper with me as sole author. The pharmaceutical
company was fine with it, as long as we acknowledged Dr. Jenkins at the end. Dr. Jenkins was
fine with it, as he really didn’t need the publication (and, maybe, as I look back on it, he didn’t
want his name on a non-peer reviewed publication). I went on from his lab to a satisfying
career. But I’ve always been bothered by this kind of odd turn of authorship events where,
instead of the usual problem of people demanding authorship credit when they don’t deserve
it, here’s an individual who should have been listed as an author but refused.
Any thoughts?","Mary is right to feel uncomfortable for all the reasons she gives. The sole (or lead) author of a
paper should not only be able to justify all the data in the paper, but assure its integrity, i.e., its
truth and its source. That assurance cannot be credible or made in good faith if the author
takes credit for someone else’s contribution. Even if Mary acknowledges Dr. Jenkins at the end
of the paper, that acknowledgement will misrepresent Dr. Jenkins role because individuals so
acknowledged are understood not to have made significant intellectual contributions. But
Jenkins certainly did.
Also, as Mary described Dr. Jenkins’s work methods, she was not in an adequate
position to actually observe his data acquisition. Could Dr. Jenkins have carelessly collected
that data or simply made it all up, and would his refusing authorship be an “out” for him—i.e.,
he could place all the culpability on Mary as sole author if allegations of data fabrication ever
arose? Let us treat this as just a hypothetical, but it is certainly a liability of X taking credit for
Y’s work when X did not supervise or oversee and, thus, cannot vouchsafe its truth.
So what could Mary have done? Well, she could have insisted that Dr. Jenkins be
second author, taking the “I simply can’t take credit for your contributions—that would be
misrepresentation” line of ethical arguing. If Jenkins still refused, Mary could have run Jenkins’s
experiments by herself and collected and published the data she generated, which she could
certainly then claim as her own. Or, she could have refused authorship of the paper altogether,
perhaps resulting in no paper and the ire of the pharmaceutical company.
It would have been nice for Dr. Jenkins to announce to Mary at the early stages of the
paper his intention to have her be sole author. That at least could have given her some time to
reflect on her situation and perhaps contemplate some of the strategies listed above. As it
actually transpired, however, Mary’s insisting that Jenkins be the second author by appealing to
ethical arguments seems to us to be the least onerous of the options. Alternatively, Mary’s
duplicating Jenkins’s experiments or refusing to submit the paper as sole author might have
earned her Jenkins’s ill will since it implies Mary’s distrust of Jenkins’s data. Of course, the
failure to submit a paper altogether might mean the pharmaceutical company’s never
underwriting Jenkins’s lab again. Considerations like these must have been especially
distressing for Mary, who as a very junior member of the lab might feel that she must get along
in order to go along. Nevertheless, this incident could have been a potent ethical moment for
both Mary and Dr. Jenkins to remind themselves of what data and authorship integrity really
mean","%Introduction:

21,"Deciding the order of authors on a manuscript is one of the most common problems
occurring in research, and here is a personal example.
This event occurred early in my graduate school career when one of my first
projects was working alongside Jim, who had been doing graduate work for some time.
Well before I arrived in the lab, Jim and his advisor had outlined and launched a series of
experiments. I then became involved in working on these experiments, first by
acquiring, analyzing and interpreting data and then by designing some of the final
experiments in the study. Subsequently, Jim wrote the majority of the first draft of a
paper we submitted, with him as first author and me second.
While the paper was under review, Jim surprised everyone by abruptly quitting
the graduate program altogether, getting married and moving to a distant city. A few
weeks after his departure, the peer reviews of the paper arrived with the provisional
decision to accept the paper but with major revisions requested. I contacted Jim, who
was now living on the other side of the U.S. He told me he was entirely disinterested in
the project and said he would be unable to contribute to the revision. So, I completed
all the requested revisions, which were quite substantial and included re-analysis and
interpretation of the data (which required some acquisition of new data as well).
At this point, Dr. Simmons who was Jim's advisor, offered me first authorship on
the paper because of my substantial contributions to its reworking and Jim's inability to
do it. I was nevertheless reluctant to accept because the initial conception and design
of the study was Jim's. I discussed this matter with my advisor, who concurred with me
that I should remain second author (which is how the matter ended).
Although I think I made the right decision on this matter, can ethics shed any
particular light on this situation? Jim was responsible for most of the design and
conception of the experiments, ran most of the initial ones and composed most of the
first draft of the paper. But I followed with a tremendous amount of revision and added
new data. While a set of guidelines for authors can be helpful, I’m wondering if such a
set can be particularly helpful in a case like this. ","The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ “Uniform Requirements” are
probably the ones most commonly and consistently cited for determining authorship
and the ordering of authors. While the “Requirements” document itself is wideranging—covering issues like editorial freedom, conflicts of interest, privacy and
confidentiality, protection of human subjects and animals, etc.—the statements that are
of particular relevance to this dilemma assert that “An ‘author’ is generally considered
to be someone who has made substantive intellectual contributions to a published
study” and that:
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception
and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) 
drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and
3) final approval of the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions
1, 2, and 3.1
Importantly, the “Requirements” also mention that “Acquisition of funding, collection of
data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship.”
Harvard’s authorship guidelines are very similar:
Everyone who is listed as an author should have made a substantial, direct,
intellectual contribution to the work. For example (in the case of a research
report) they should have contributed to the conception, design, analysis and/or
interpretation of data. Honorary or guest authorship is not acceptable.
Acquisition of funding and provision of technical services, patients, or materials,
while they may be essential to the work, are not in themselves sufficient
contributions to justify authorship…Authors should specify in their manuscript a
description of the contributions of each author and how they have assigned the
order in which they are listed so that readers can interpret their roles correctly.2
Now, the point of citing these various passages is that if we would strictly apply them to
the case at hand, one might judge that Jim (who was the original author) ultimately
should not be listed on the rewrite as an author at all. The reason is that the Uniform
Requirements require all three criteria—i.e., conception/design contribution, drafting or
rewriting of the article, and final approval—to be met for an individual to qualify as
author. According to the case report, however, Jim only completed half of them. He
had nothing to do with the extensive rewrite—and recall that the rewrite included a reanalysis and re-interpretation of the data—so that Jim’s “final approval” (i.e.,
accommodating authorship criterion #3) of the redraft would be in name only. How
could Jim “approve” something in whose compilation and analysis he played no role
whatsoever and, therefore, whose substantive accuracy or quality he cannot begin to
assure or guarantee?
On the other hand, denying Jim authorship altogether seems unjust. After all, it
was his conception and design that propelled the experiment forward; he collected and
analyzed the bulk of the first batch of data; and he wrote the majority of the first
manuscript. Also, the graduate student probably benefited from Jim’s leadership and
energy, such that the idea of denying Jim authorship would seem remarkably callous
(although, arguably, legalistically correct).
This case is a good example of the way any research project that involves
multiple persons participating in the collection and interpretation of data according to
an experimental design might encounter problems in estimating the nature and scope
of each one’s ultimate contribution in deciding the order of authorship. As Bates et al
pointed out, any individual among multiple authors might contribute to any of the
following categories in developing a research publication:
1. conception and design of the study
2. analysis and interpretation of data
3. collection or assembly of data
4. statistical expertise
5. provision of student material or patients
6. drafting of the article or part of the article
7. critical revision of the article
8. obtaining funding.
9. administrative, technical or logistic support
10. guarantor of the study
11. study supervision or coordination3
Now, while certain of these categories by themselves would not qualify one for
authorship, suppose Researcher A claims a contribution of 20 percent to category #1, 10
percent to category #6, and 40 percent to category #7, while Researcher B claims 80
percent to category #1, 15 percent to #2, and so on. If they would clash over whose
name should have precedence on the authors’ list, ethics would have very little to say
about how that precedence should be specifically determined. There is no objective
metric that can consistently and decisively adjudicate disputes over ordering the
authorial pecking order.
The Harvard criteria recognize this by noting that “it is not possible to interpret
from order of authorship the respective contributions of individual authors.” So, the
Harvard guidelines recommend that “The authors should decide the order of authorship
together…(and) specify in their manuscript a description of the contributions of each
author and how they have assigned the order…so that readers can interpret their roles
correctly.” Importantly: “Research teams should discuss authorship issues frankly early
in the course of their work together.”
In the above case, no authorship problems appeared until the first draft was
returned with the demand for major revisions. It was at that point, when Jim refused to
participate in the rewrite, that authorship issues became problematic. Once the
quantity of work required by the rewrite became apparent, the grad student should
have contacted Jim and prepared to have a conversation that would probably not be
without some emotional discomfort. As initiated by the grad student, the conversation
might have proceeded like this:
Jim, this is a bit difficult for me to tell you, but in view of your inability to assist
with the massive revisions that the manuscript’s resubmission will require, Dr.
Simmons and I believe that you should be second author with me first. I want to
tell you this before we go too far, so you can mull it over and give us your
thoughts. Certainly your initial contributions were considerable, but the rewrite
will so dramatically change the manuscript from its original form that we believe
the order of authorship has to reflect that. Also, if you would insist on remaining
first author, there’s no way you could legitimately approve the rewrite as you
will have overseen none of it. So, we’d have a real ethical problem there.
This last point seems conclusive. The fact that Jim was ultimately retained as first
author, while certainly respectful of his original thoughtfulness and energy,
misrepresents his accountability for the revised submission. After all, the first author
should be able to guarantee and stand behind the article as a whole by way of his or her
familiarity with, if not input into, each of its elements. Jim’s removing himself from
those tasks therefore serves to displace him as first author.
Summary: While criteria whereby authorship ordering might be imprecise, any
designated first author should be able to stand behind and justify a research
publication’s various findings and claims. In this scenario, the original first author would
not have been able to perform these functions as his contribution to the much revised
resubmission was nil. Although his contribution to the original research design and data
collection was crucial and fundamental, it was not enough to sustain a claim to first
authorship of the revision","%Introduction:

22,"A few years ago, I did something distinctly unethical. I was in the process of submitting a paper, which had gone through all its revisions and been approved by all the investigators in the study. Literally at the time I was uploading the paper into the manuscript submission site, I was contacted by one of the investigators. She wanted me to add the names of three more people. They worked in the same department as she, and they all had a mutual agreement to put each other's names on papers they were submitting. These additional “authors” had allowed us to enroll several of their patients for the study, but they only had a general idea of what the study was about and definitely did not contribute anything of intellectual value to the paper. My problem was that I was in no position to say no. Had I denied the request, these individuals could have kept me from completing my thesis which required their assistance to recruit patients. Also, they could have hindered my post-graduate job search. When I discussed all this with my advisor, he agreed that to add their names was unethical, but he too was powerless in dealing with the situation. So, the three were added. To make matters worse, I found out later that the investigators receive bonus money from their department at the end of the year based on publications. I can't help but think such an inducement was in the back of their minds when they all agreed to put each other's names on any research papers they submitted. And maybe the worst part of all this is that if the situation were to arise today with one of my students, I'd probably advise him or her to handle it as I did. The penalties for not playing along, even if the game is unethical, are too uninviting.","Of course, the dilemma contributor is correct to indict as unethical the addition of three
more names to his author list, as those persons contributed nothing of intellectual
substance to the paper. Similarly, the “I put your name(s) on my papers and you put
mine on yours” is a remarkably dishonest policy which, as practiced in a department
that provides bonuses to investigators based on their number of publications, amounts
to fraud.
The ethical problem that this scenario raises, however, is how does an institution
“police” its investigators so that these kinds of behaviors do not occur. (Just imagine if a
New York Times reporter found all this out with indisputable evidence and published a
front page expose!)
 Although this first recommendation might seem disingenuous, it isn’t: The
investigators who engage in this “authorship inflation” practice must understand it is
unethical. Given the never-ending pressure to publish, it is easy to see how
investigators might convince themselves that they are doing nothing wrong, i.e., that
virtually any contribution of any kind—perhaps just a word of advice from another 
investigator—amounts to an “intellectual contribution.” Alternatively, some
investigators might passionately insist that colleagues who supply materials (such as
reagents or access to potential research participants) deserve to have their names on
the author list because they made the experiment possible.
This sort of self-deception can only be sustained if the institution fails in its ethical
responsibilities to maintain a culture of responsible conduct of research. Institutional
ethical responsibilities minimally include routinely providing continuing ethics education
to students and faculty that communicates, in the case of authorship, all of the
following: (1) the fundamental principle that governs authorship, i.e., “a significant
intellectual contribution”; (2) concrete examples of what that principle means, e.g., by
way of case studies involving granting authorship based on “a word of advice” or,
notoriously, the supply of reagents; (3) explanations of why the institution has adopted
these authorship principles and why they must be sustained; and (4) where
investigators who are experiencing authorship dilemmas such as the one recounted
here can go for help and institutional support.
If it is the case—as it certainly seems to be—that a tremendous amount of trust
must be granted to investigators in view of the impossibility of any institution’s
monitoring their conduct every minute of the day, then certain investigators might need
to be occasionally reminded of and impressed with the significance of practicing the
virtues. In other words, that:
 misrepresentation in any form is wrong;
 good science consists in the pursuit of truth in all respects;
 good scientists, like good chess players, do not cheat;
 maintaining a falsehood requires constant strain and effort and is usually
uncovered anyway;
 those who participate with one another in sustaining a falsehood cannot trust
one another and, hence, cannot engage in good science or sustain good collegial
relations;
 falsity in one aspect of research is likely to invite falsity in other aspects;
 rewards can only improve productivity if they are provided for genuine
accomplishment.
Authorship rules should also be promulgated in departmental policy manuals.
Moreover, journals have very explicit requirements for authorship that often have to be
signed by all the authors. In the present case, if the dilemma contributor attested to the
fact that all the authors made a “significant intellectual contribution” to the article, he
or she might well be accused of misrepresentation (as well as certain of the authors who
attested to the same).
Of course, authorship rules or criteria must be enforced by administration and
leadership. But it is unrealistic for administration and leadership, especially at large
universities, to scrupulously investigate and assure the integrity of the author list of
every publication. Consequently, research environments must cultivate an atmosphere
where investigators feel safe in speaking up about practices whose moral propriety they
question. In such instances, the troubled investigator should:
(1) Ascertain whether the practice he or she questions is in fact a rule or policy
violation by collecting as much information as possible (e.g., policy and
procedure statements, the ethical literature, etc.) to determine whether or not
the practice in question is indeed an ethical violation;
(2) Discuss all these findings along with a remediative strategy with a trusted,
experienced colleague who has a reputation for integrity and confidentiality;
(3) Approach the presumptive wrongdoers (or if this is an unrealistic
expectation, approach one or more trusted persons in positions of power),
discuss the problem, and work to correct the problem with an ethically
acceptable intervention; sometimes, and often depending on the gravity of the
issue, this might entail notifying leadership or administration of what has
occurred;
(4) If #3 fails, take the matter up the chain of command, such as the University’s
Office of Research Integrity, until a resolution that accords with ethical
guidelines is reached.
In all of this, the investigator must feel safe and confident that any attempt to retaliate
against him or her will fail and likely result in the situation worsening for the
retaliator(s). Moreover, the investigator must feel robustly confident that a
constructive leadership response as in #4 will occur. Otherwise, it is unlikely that a
complaint will be undertaken. The contributor of this dilemma is unable to take all of
these steps—although it sounds like he or she has performed the first two—because he
or she cannot count on leadership for support.
This dilemma points to a lack of organizational or institutional morality, such that
moral transgressions are condoned; indeed, they seem to be normalized at this
institution. Until that changes, one can understand the dilemma contributor’s frank
admission that little should be expected by way of correcting this problem.
Organizations should only expect their personnel to routinely take the high moral
ground in forwarding an ethics complaint if the complainant anticipates a fair and safe
hearing and a serious organizational response to the complaint. And organizations can
only expect their researchers to sustain a culture of responsibility if they are proactive in
educating researchers about what is expected from them. Imagine how much more
easily this ethical dilemma could have been resolved early on if, upon receiving the
contact from the investigator, the dilemma contributor had been able to respond, “But I
don’t know if we can do this – remember the workshop last month in which we learned
that it would be a violation of institutional policy to list authors who had not made an
intellectual contribution. I don’t want to get any of us, or our institution, into trouble.”
Summary: Ethical dilemmas such as the one described above can be compounded,
indeed enabled, by organizational lapses that condone wayward policies and practices.
In such instances, leadership, integrity and character that enforces ethical guidelines
and provides a safe working environment for ethics complaints to be heard and
discussed is utterly indispensable. Cultivating a culture of responsibility in the conduct of
research requires proactive, ongoing, and multiple educational efforts to make clear 
what the standards are, how they are to be applied in practice, and why the institution
has adopted them.","%Introduction:

23,"Dr. Cooper, a tenure track assistant professor, noted that one of the senior researchers
in his area of research, Dr. Wittgenstein, had recently published an important paper in
the field and had generated some valuable reagents in the process. Cooper contacted
Wittgenstein and asked if he could obtain these reagents, telling Wittgenstein how he
planned to use them. Wittgenstein agreed to send the reagents to Cooper and even
mentioned that he was making additional reagents that might be use for Copper's
future experiments.
After a year of successful experiments using the reagents, Cooper's group wrote a paper
and submitted it to a prestigious journal that rapidly accepted and published it. Shortly
thereafter, Cooper received a phone call from Wittgenstein who asked why his name
had not appeared on the paper. Cooper replied that providing reagents does not merit
an authorship credit. Wittgenstein countered that it is nevertheless common courtesy
to do so and that his lab works incredibly hard to generate these reagents. Wittgenstein
then informed Cooper that he would not share any reagents with him in the future, nor
would he supply him with additional quantities of the original reagents that Cooper
used.
Cooper dismissed this all as a bad experience. Nevertheless, he called several
colleagues who confirmed that while the official rules say that you do not include
people as authors who simply provide reagents, everyone does it.
Over the next several years, Wittgenstein continued to send reagents to other labs who
would include him as an author on their papers. These labs flourished and received
continued funding. Cooper, however, suffered considerably. His having to generate
reagents on his own took over two years, during which time he lost a competitive edge
with other labs. This, in turn, jeopardized Cooper's bid for tenure. On the other hand,
Cooper did consider contacting those journals where Dr. Wittgenstein's name was
appearing and filing numerous complaints, but he dismissed this idea as too uncollegial.
While Dr. Cooper was clearly correct in following rules of authorship credit, it is just as
clear that others weren't. Their's was an ethically dubious reciprocity arrangement
where Wittgenstein's supplying them a reagent would result in his receiving an
authorship credit. Had there been better policing of such arrangements, this sort of
thing would presumably happen less often. But as it presently stood, the consequences
from acting ethically seemed career jeopardizing for the Dr. Coopers of the world, and
career-aggrandizing for the likes of Dr. Wittgenstein. Sadly, as the majority of the
scientific community was inclined to follow the less ethical course, Dr. Cooper found
himself suffering for doing the right thing.
As an aside but to top it all off, Dr. Wittgenstein insisted on authorship credit for himself
but not for his trainees, who did all the work in generating the reagents.
Any ethical suggestions?","Dr. Cooper might feel that all his moral courage accomplished was getting his head
handed to him on a platter. Surely Cooper was in the right. As discussed in other
dilemmas on this website, authorship requires a “significant intellectual contribution” to
the paper, which Wittgenstein clearly did not make.
Indeed, if ethical behavior as Kant or Mill suggested tends to be “other regarding”—that is, that ethical behavior fosters the welfare of other persons or is done for the sake of ethical principle—Wittgenstein’s expectations of authorship were decidedly self-interested and would misrepresent his
role in Cooper’s publication. Representing Wittgenstein as an author would violate the
ethical obligation of veracity. But Wittgenstein and others like him have no problem
with that, probably owing to the comfort level that has evolved among researchers over
decades of naming authors for extra-intellectual reasons (e.g., out of courtesy or as a
favor, as an acknowledgement of their power or prestige, or out of gratitude for their
supplying some material that enabled the experiment but not the manuscript).
In taking his stand against Wittgenstein, was Cooper not a bit naïve in failing to
anticipate that Wittgenstein would expect an authorship credit? Was Cooper let down
by his past advisors and training committees who failed to teach him the “informal
curriculum” of how things really happen in academic publishing? We are not condoning
the unethical here but rather considering that had Cooper anticipated Wittgenstein’s
expectation of authorship, he might have been able to negotiate an understanding with
Wittgenstein that could have prevented the problem. For example, he could have told
Wittgenstein at the time he made his reagent request that his policy is not to offer
authorship to researchers who supply him with reagents, but that he would be delighted
if Wittgenstein would formally contribute to the manuscript, perhaps by writing some of
the opening literature review. Certainly, Cooper should have been suspicious of
Wittgenstein’s name appearing on so many papers. And regardless of Wittgenstein’s
response to Cooper’s offer, Cooper’s being more deferential and respectful, political as
it might be, would have helped. Obviously, when these issues are handled more
delicately than confrontationally, the outcomes tend to be better.
Cooper should also have kept his own supervisor informed of all this and made
sure he got his backing. We do not believe that Cooper had a categorical moral
obligation to make a cause celebre out of this incident per his filing complaints against
Wittgenstein with other journals. But that is certainly his option, depending on how
much career damage Cooper is willing to absorb. Our experience has been that the
usual response to loud accusations of powerful people violating rules is that they often
find new and more devious ways to get around the rules or, very commonly, will launch
a prolonged counterattack, which can result in unpleasant and often career-damaging
affairs. Cooper must realize that although he might feel a strong urge to fight this
dragon, it would be dangerous for him and his career to press on at this time.
One thing that can be done to curtail the notoriously common practice of
offering authorship to persons who contribute nary a sentence to a manuscript is for all
scientific journals to adopt the policy of a number of outstanding ones (e.g., JAMA):
Demand listing the nature of the contribution of all the authors at the end of the article.
This drives the principle of veracity home because Wittgenstein would either have had
to contribute to the article or the authors would have had to lie (i.e., claim that
Wittgenstein contributed this or that to the article when he didn’t).
Perhaps this kind of journalistic practice would make scientists who are too
generous with assigning authorship credits think twice about misrepresenting other
investigators’ roles. But as it currently stands, Dr. Cooper is sadly learning that it is the
rare university where a faculty member’s path is not cluttered with politics and
challenges such as this one. Cooper must clearly decide whether and to what extent he
wants to fight this battle, but he might consider the advice of Italo Calvino on how to
manage “the inferno” of the living:
The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is
already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being
together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many:
accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.
The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and
learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then
make them endure, give them space

24,"I had an upsetting experience a few years ago in gathering data and preparing a
manuscript. At first, everything was going fine: I was working as a research assistant,
and my professor and the rest of the research team were nicely in synch. As we laid out
everyone’s responsibilities for the experiment, it was decided that I would be primary
author and the professor last author. As we ended our data collection and proceeded to
analyze it, my professor hired another faculty member in our department, a statistician,
and asked the statistician to look at the paper. The statistician did and made some
recommendations that were easily incorporated. Some months then went by, but my
professor did not submit it. When I asked him why, he said that the statistician had
decided to rewrite it. The real surprise came some weeks later when my professor told
me that the paper was finished, but that the statistician had put so much time on it that
she had convinced him that she should be first author.
I was quite upset but I respected the professor and went along. My question is,
“Can one rewrite a paper with data that is not your own and claim first authorship?” I
was the agreed upon first author, so technically it was my call to decide if someone
should be listed as an author or just acknowledged. But as a graduate student, what
clout did I have against a faculty member? The politics of the department seemed to
trash the initial agreement about the order of authorship. And I would say that that was
unethical, wouldn’t you?","This scenario presents a good example of what happens when promises are not kept,
loyalties shift, and “lab politics” go contrary to what justice or professionalism would
recommend. Let us begin by sorting out some key issues and problems:
(1) How binding was the decision, made at the initial planning of the manuscript,
that the research assistant would be first author? Assuming the PI ultimately has
the power to override such determinations, under what conditions might the
ordering of authors be legitimately changed? Have the conditions or criteria
under which overriding might occur been promulgated, discussed, and accepted
by everyone in the lab? Have they been justly arrived at? All of this seems very
important as it bears on the credibility of the research assistant’s saying, “I was
the agreed upon first author, so technically it was my call to decide if someone
should be listed as an author or just acknowledged.”
(2) The newly hired statistician looks over the paper and makes some
recommendations that are “easily incorporated.” Why didn’t the issue end there
with the paper being submitted, now perhaps with the statistician’s name
somewhere down on the author list? Why didn’t the PI move the paper forward
by returning it to the research assistant with a “good to go” decision and with
the research assistant as first author as originally planned? 
(3) Issue #1 comes home to roost when after some months, the research
assistant learns that the statistician has decided to “rewrite” the paper. This is
obviously a crucial moment in the trajectory of this scenario as it raises the
question of who “owns” the manuscript in terms of the authority to control its
form and content and assign first authorship.
(4) Investigators must make a “significant intellectual contribution” to the
manuscript to qualify as authors.1 Can the sheer amount of time and effort that
one contributes to a manuscript, even though he or she had nothing to do with
the project’s experimental design or data collection, promote one to first
author? Clearly, the statistician made an intellectual contribution, but was it
sufficient enough to justify altering the order of authorship from the original
understanding?
We believe this case scenario illustrates a number of leadership failures on the PI’s part.
First of all, any PI should realize that the order of authorship on a publication is not
something to be taken lightly, such that once that order is established or understood,
only very serious factors should be allowed to intervene to change it. Good leadership
would require that this understanding be formally and firmly established, recognized,
and insisted upon in the lab by all relevant personnel. In its absence, such as when a
reordering of the authorship list occurs without explanation, it is easy to see how an
atmosphere of mistrust and animosity can develop.
Given the significance of the order of authors and the inevitability of statistical
input and effort on many papers, one would like to see an explicit, formal understanding
among lab personnel on how statistical contributions will be understood per the
ordering of authorship. We believe that questions like “Can the sheer amount of time
and effort that one contributes to a manuscript, even though he or she had nothing to
do with the project’s experimental design or collection of data, promote one to first
author?” should be formally decided in advance and in a principled manner. We suggest
that the answer usually (although perhaps not always) be “NO.” Now, there might be
cases where a statistical reworking of the data might entail considerable changes in the
entire manuscript, perhaps even extending to the reworking of the experimental design
or to the re-representation of the data. But if the investigators had done what they are
supposed to do—which is to have selected a sound statistical approach to the data as
part of the research plan before data collection begins—these cases should be minimal.
Still, one can’t always predict how the data will turn out (and, thus, how the
paper will be written). While our recommending an authorship discussion at the
beginning of the project is certainly useful, it is also critical that the decisions made at
that meeting are regularly revisited and revised as necessary, using the information and
experience gathered from the research. A good analogy is to obtaining informed
consent in clinical research. It should be an ongoing process, not a one-time binding
event.
But suppose something like this happened: The statistical processing of the data
was early decided upon and unproblematically executed. But when the new statistician
came on board, he or she brought along a very different methodological approach that 
triggered all the fuss. If so, once the statistician became aware of how much work
would be required in rewriting the manuscript, why didn’t he or she request a meeting
with the PI and the research assistant to explain the situation? At that point, the PI
could have negotiated or simply decided whether to accept or reject the statistician’s
position and/or revisit the question on how authorship would be decided. Alternatively,
it is sometimes the case that studies are done and large amounts of data are collected.
In such instances, there can be many ways in which the data can be analyzed and
discussed, resulting in multiple papers with different first authors. If that were the
situation in this case, a more appropriate response on the PI’s part might be to have the
research assistant submit the original paper as first author and have the statistician
submit a second paper as first author. At least that kind of open, thoughtful, and
democratic decision making would have been much more preferable to the tacit
agreement that developed between the PI and the statistician that the manuscript could
only be rewritten with the statistician as first author. Given the facts as related here, it
can only seem that the PI thoughtlessly dishonored the initial authorship agreement in
favor of lab politics—where the statistician’s faculty status resulted in a preferential
decision over the lowly research assistant.
Summary: This scenario resulted from the following failures:
1. The failure to honor or at least revisit the original understanding of the
authorship order when complications arose.
2. The failure to discuss reasons for delaying submission of the manuscript,
which surely was uncomfortable to the research assistant.
3. The failure to communicate openly about the statistician’s concerns and
anticipation of effort and how that might affect the authorship ordering.
4. The failure, on both the PI’s and the statistician’s parts, to extend equal
respect to the research assistant as a valued member of the laboratory.
If these failures had not occurred, it seems unlikely that the difficult question of
whether or not “the sheer amount of time and effort that one contributes to a
manuscript, even though he or she had nothing to do with the project’s experimental
design or data collection, (could) promote one to first author” would have needed to be
considered. ","%Introduction:

25,"David is a new postdoc in Dr. Goliath’s lab. Upon David’s arrival to the lab, Dr. Goliath assigned
him a few experiments to firm up some results of a paper that had been rejected by a journal.
These experiments had not been performed because the technician who was working on the
project and was the rejected paper’s first author had since left the lab. David was given a copy
of the (rejected) manuscript to review and to assess what needed to be done for a second
submission. After reading the paper, David felt that the quality of the writing was poor and
that, along with including the results from the control experiments Dr. Goliath asked him to do,
the manuscript needed to be completely re-written.
David expressed all this to Dr. Goliath, who agreed that David should take ownership of
the paper and improve it. Upon completing and adding the results of the control experiments
and then re-writing the original manuscript entirely, David re-submitted the paper without
consulting the original author who had performed the bulk of the work of the original
manuscript. The reviewers gave enthusiastic reviews of the re-submission and the paper was
accepted with minor revisions
Was it appropriate that David replaced the original author as first author? Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab? Should the technician
have been informed about the changes to the manuscript prior to the new submission? Should
the technician have been invited to comment on or contribute to the new submission?","A key source of ethical guidance in resolving this dilemma is the opinion of the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which recommends that:
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and
design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of
the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3 … Each author
should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for
appropriate portions of the content.
Suppose that the original, lab technician author found out about the successful re-submission
of the paper and complains that he is no longer first author. (Indeed, we are not told whether
he was retained as an author at all, but let us assume he was.) Using the ICMJE’s authorship
criteria, how might an ad hoc committee (or reasonable facsimile) resolve such a complaint?
Certainly, a key issue in deliberating over who should be first author must revolve
around the re-submission’s “intellectual content.” We are told that David performed new
control experiments, whose findings he included in the re-submission, and that David also
completely re-wrote the original paper. But if this is the extent of David’s work, then the lab
technician seems to be able to make a strong claim to be retained as first author—that is, if his
original “contribution,” i.e., the experimental design, and most of the data and their analyses
and interpretation, were substantially if not “phraseologically” retained in the re-submission
and constituted the bulk of the re-submission’s findings.
To appreciate this, consider the following hypothetical situation: Instead of assigning
the do-over of the paper to David, suppose Dr. Goliath has a graduate student perform the new
control experiments. Upon collecting that data, Goliath then hires a ghost writer/copy editor
(who is not a professional scientist) and says, “Here’s a rejected manuscript with some new
data. I want you to re-write this paper as best you can and incorporate the data from these
new experiments.” Now, it is quite possible that this copy editor could produce a paper very
similar if not identical to David’s, but we would probably hesitate giving him an authorship
credit at all, much less assigning him first authorship.
Consequently, a crucial question that an ethical review of this case would have to
address is: How different and elaborate must the intellectual content of David’s resubmission
be from the original in order for David to replace the lab technician as first author? Did the
overall conception and design of the original paper’s experimental approach change
significantly with the re-submission? Were the data analyzed and interpreted differently?
Were new implications of the data presented?
The outcome of this analysis would answer the above question about the propriety of
David’s replacing the original author as a new first author. As to the question, “Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab?” we say, “Probably not.”
Considered as intellectual property, the original, rejected paper and its ideas belong and have
always belonged to the lab, so that David doesn’t need the technician’s permission to revisit the
original paper.
This is a very important point if the University would ever wish to patent any
aspects of the materials of the original paper (regardless of whether it does or doesn’t appear
in a professional journal). The University owns and has always owned the paper’s ideas and
discoveries such that had the original paper been submitted and been accepted but the lab
technician had left the lab for a new position in the meantime, he or she would have to reveal
the fact that the research was conducted at the University while he was employed there, and
not give the erroneous impression that his new employer—whose name would certainly appear
on the paper as his current employer—owns the paper’s content as intellectual property. In
sum, the University, through Dr. Goliath, seems certainly within its rights to re-assign the
rejected paper to someone else and to have that individual revise the paper accordingly.
However, we strongly believe that the technician should have been invited to respond
to the revision before it was re-submitted—both to respond to its content as well as to his
losing first-authorship. Indeed, it seems remarkably unprofessional as well as a violation of the
ICMJE’s guidelines to place the tech’s name on the re-submission—if that in fact happened—
without his having reviewed and approved it. A pre-submission communication from David to
the technician should have informed him of the revision, explained why he (David) deserves
first authorship, and invite the technician to contribute to the revision. As occurs so often in
these kinds of cases, treating an original research contributor as though he or she no longer
exists explains how so many of these disputes originate.
So, let us conclude by returning to the issue of assessing the scope and content of
David’s revision. If we imagine an authorial continuum whose one pole is a vastly re-written
but nevertheless relatively intact preservation of the lab technician’s original intellectual
contribution(s) with the other pole of the continuum a completely new version of the original
paper’s experimental design, data, and findings, then first authorship should be determined
according to which pole on that authorial continuum (represented by David at one end and the
lab technician at the other) the resubmission’s content veers and lands. As this dilemma might
play out, however, it would be easy to imagine the lab technician’s ire should he read the resubmission’s eventual publication and exclaim, “But these are mostly my ideas and data! And I
was never contacted!” Again, some thoughtful communications among David, Dr. Goliath, and
the lab technician prior to the revision’s being re-submitted is the preferable approach to take.

26,"The research I was doing involved working with tissue samples from a large number of
patient-donors that were collected over the course of 20 years. IRB approval for
acquiring specimens and protocols were obtained according to institutional and federal
government guidelines and the study proceeded without incident. Indeed, the lab
published several important papers in the field and, of course, maintained the privacy
and confidentiality of all donors.
But one day when I was well into my work, I was nonchalantly informed by one
of the principal investigators in the lab of the identity of one of the donors of our
specimens. The donor was a highly visible, nationally known celebrity.
I never found out how this investigator came to know this tissue donor's identity.
To my knowledge, the only information that the laboratory staff had was their donor's
age, sex, and race. In fact, none of the laboratory's documentation described any donor
in any specific terms. Nevertheless, and as result of this revelation, I was faced with the
problem of deciding whether or not to continue to conduct research using cells derived
from this individual. This was especially problematic for me because this donor's cells
had been very useful to me, yielding promising and exciting data up to that point.
Ultimately, I decided that it would be inappropriate for me to continue
conducting experiments using cultures from cells derived from this person. But I
wonder if I was being ""too ethical."" Was I?","Before 1990, stored tissue was routinely used for research without any consent from
the tissue donor. Two events changed that. The Centers for Disease Control wished to
do genetics research on its extensive sample collection. Realizing that genetic research
might be sensitive for numerous reasons, in 1994 the CDC seated the Clayton Consensus
Panel to give ethical guidance. This panel devoted much discussion to using sample
banks obtained without consent; but it also recommended that henceforth, consent
should be sought before samples are banked or used for research.


At approximately the same time, John Moore sued the Regents of the University
of California for breach of fiduciary duty. In 1979, a UC researcher arranged for research
on Mr. Moore’s tissue obtained from a splenectomy as part of his treatment for hairy
cell leukemia, without disclosure to the patient. For the next seven years, the patient
traveled from Seattle to UCLA to give blood, blood serum, skin, bone marrow aspirate
and sperm that were deemed “necessary and required for his health and well being.” In
its ruling, the Court recognized that the potential market of lymphokines developed
from Mr. Moore’s tissue was about $3 billion, but did not recognize his right to this
money. It did rule that the physicians had breached their fiduciary duty to the patient
and had not obtained proper informed consent. (Moore v. Regents of the University of
California, 793-P.2d 479 (Cal. 1990).
These two rulings, one ethical and one legal, established the standard requiring
informed consent for research on human tissue. There are several ethically important
categories of research tissue:
totally anonymized samples that can no longer be linked to the donor;
unlinked samples that are sent to investigators without codes or identifiers,
though they are linked to identifiers in the bank, so that they are anonymous
for this investigator;
coded samples that are linked to the donor by codes;
identified samples.
In the above case, since it was possible for the Principal Investigator (PI) to identify the
donor—though the student researcher only knew the donor’s age, race and sex—we
can assume the samples were either unlinked or coded with the code unavailable to the
student researcher.2
 If the IRB at this institution was following standard procedures for
unlinked or coded samples, it would only have approved a protocol that specified that
the researchers would know the donor’s age, race, and sex; not his or her identity. If
this is in fact what the protocol governing this research stated, this revelation of identity
must be the result of a protocol violation (at a minimum).
More importantly, we must consider whether this revelation of identity harmed the
donor and contradicted his/her informed consent for research use of his/her tissue, if
there was consent. Since the tissue that this student is using in his or her research was
obtained in the last 20 years, it might have been obtained without consent given that
the standard regarding consent changed in the middle ‘90’s. Most ethical statements
allowed use of pre-consent archived samples if anonymized. If coded, many ethical
statements required obtaining consent.
 Since this sample was clearly not
anonymized, consent was probably obtained from the donor. That consent, assuming it
was standard, would have assured the donor that his/her identity would be protected
and not released to researchers. Here is a standard statement:
We would like to give the Researchers information – such as whether you are
male or female, your age, your race and information about health related issues,
including information such as your history of smoking, current medical or
surgical diagnosis or previous medical treatments. Information that identifies
you, like your name or address, will not be given and will remain confidential.
(Emory Front Door consent).
If the consent was standard, the PI has now clearly acted in contradiction to what the
protocol promised the donor. The principle of research ethics that has been the
bedrock principle since the Nuremberg Code—to only do research with consent—has
been broken. The student rightly identifies that she is in an ethical pickle.
However, we believe the question the student asks herself is not the right one. She asks:
should I continue using this tissue? It is no wonder she is perplexed by this question,
because as the investigator, she is not the right one to answer that question. We have
found through decades of unfortunate experiences, that the investigator alone should
not be expected to answer difficult research ethics questions. Instead, in the United 
States, we have developed patient and investigator protection systems, with entities
removed from the research and presumably not biased by their participation in the
research, who are charged with making these important ethical decisions.
The objective in this case would be to engage an unbiased body in serious ethical
reflection about how best to protect this donor, as well as how to go forward with what
may be research that is beneficial to many before we could decide this. Certainly, the
institution’s IRB would be clearly involved. The student has witnessed both a protocol
and a consent violation, and the IRB must be notified of both. Of course, we do not
underestimate how difficult this is for a student when the violator is his or her PI. But
many institutions have ombudsmen or ethics consult services that can help a student
navigate this difficult situation. But only an unbiased group, like an IRB, should make the
determination of whether or not these ethically compromised samples can be used.
More important, the IRB or the Office of Research Compliance can investigate the
system failure that allowed these violations to occur. If the PI knows this sample’s
donor’s identity, the system in place to protect confidentiality is obviously flawed and
must be corrected before any tissue research can continue. Otherwise, the informed
consent that is so painstakingly obtained for samples is undermined by a system that
disrespects the informed consent’s parameters. All research from this tissue bank is
potentially in jeopardy of being conducted unethically. The student has uncovered a
serious organizational ethics problem. It is not the student’s responsibility to solve this
problem, but it is the student’s responsibility to notify the entity in the organization that
has the power and expertise to solve it.
So, should the student continue to use the sample? One resolutional strategy would be
to engage an unbiased body in serious ethical reflection about how best to protect this
donor, as well as how to go forward with what may be research that is beneficial to
many before we could decide this. Nevertheless, we believe it is very unlikely that this
deliberation will conclude that the student can proceed since the student now knows
this donor’s identity and will be finding out personal information about the donor’s
sample. It is very likely that the student will be unable to disassociate from a person
whose identity she knows (and even if she is psychological able to do this, other
students might not). Having this knowledge without consent will be an assault on the
donor’s privacy. But, if the research is important enough, it may be possible to transfer
this line of research to another investigator in such a way that the donor’s identity is
once again concealed.
A provocative approach that, as far as we know is untried, is to contact the donor and
disclose the breach. (This would not be disanalogous to informing a patient who has
experienced a medical error about the event.) Rather than make a unilateral
institutional decision to have the student or someone else use the sample or not, the
sensibilities of the donor can be ascertained with, of course, an apology issuing from the
institution. Now, such a disclosure opens the possibility that the donor might sue the
institution for breaching confidentiality, but for the suit to succeed, the donor would 
have to show that the confidentiality breach was so injurious to him or her—e.g.,
seriously compromised his or her earning capacity or resulted in physical illness—that
asking for compensable damages would seem reasonable.
In any event, this incident certainly deserves to be investigated for the reasons
mentioned although anyone can appreciate the degree of moral courage that would be
required of the dilemma contributor to start the investigational ball rolling.

27,"The research I was doing involved working with tissue samples from a large number of
patient-donors that were collected over the course of 20 years. The protocols for acquiring
specimens were approved by the IRB according to institutional and federal guidelines and the
study proceeded without incident. Indeed, the lab published several important papers in the
field and maintained the privacy and confidentiality of all donors.
 But one day when I was well into my work, I was nonchalantly informed by one of the
principal investigators in the lab of the identity of one of the donors of our specimens. The
donor was a highly visible, nationally known celebrity.
 I never found out how this investigator came to know this tissue donor's identity. To
my knowledge, the only information that the laboratory staff had was the donor's age, sex,
race, and de-identified medical history. In fact, none of the laboratory's documentation
included any protected health information (PHI) since all were coded. Nevertheless, and as
result of this revelation, I was faced with the problem of deciding whether or not to continue to
conduct research using cells derived from this individual. This was especially problematic for me
because this donor's cells had been very useful to my work, yielding promising and exciting data
up to that point.
 Ultimately, I decided that it would be inappropriate for me to continue conducting
experiments using cultures from cells derived from this person. But I wonder if I was being ""too
ethical."" Was I?","Prior to 1990, stored tissue was routinely used for research without obtaining any
consent of the tissue donor. Two events changed that. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
wished to do genetics research on its extensive sample collection. Realizing that genetic
research might be sensitive for numerous reasons, in 1994, the CDC seated the Clayton
Consensus Panel to give ethical guidance. This panel deliberated about the use of specimens
that were obtained without consent and ultimately recommended that henceforth, consent
should be sought before samples are banked or used for research.
1 At approximately the same
time, Mr. Moore sued the Regents of the University of California for breach of fiduciary duty. In
1979, a University of California researcher arranged for research on Mr. Moore’s tissue
obtained from a splenectomy as part of his treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The researcher
did not inform Mr. Moore about the research. For the next seven years, Mr. Moore traveled
from Seattle to UCLA to give blood, blood serum, skin, bone marrow aspirate and sperm-all
taken as “necessary and required for his health and well being.” In its landmark decision, the
Supreme Court of California recognized that the potential market of lymphokines developed
from Mr. Moore’s tissue was valued at over $3.01 billion.2 While the Court did not recognize 
Mr. Moore’s right to share in the profits of the products derived from his cells, they did rule
that the physician had breached his fiduciary duty to the patient since he had not obtained
proper informed consent.3 These two rulings, one legal and one ethical, established the
standard of requiring informed consent for research on human tissue.
There are several categories of ethical importance research tissue may fall in: (1)
Unlinked (irreversibly anonymized) samples that can no longer be linked to the donor; (2)
coded samples that are linked to the donor by codes but only the tissue bank has access to the
identifiers (reversibly anonymized); and (3) identified samples.4 IRBs can release identifiers if
the research cannot be conducted without them but the student researcher knew that their
protocol had requested coded samples, with only the tissue bank having access to identifiers.5
A breach of protocol had occurred since the PI knew the donor’s identity.
Additionally, we must consider whether this revelation of identity harmed the donor
and contradicted his/her informed consent for research use of his/her tissue, if there was
consent. Since the tissue that this student is using in her research was obtained in the last 20
years, it is likely the sample was consented for research as a result of mid 90’s reforms that set
standards regarding informed consent. That consent, assuming it was standard, would have
assured the donor that his/her identity would be protected and not known to researchers. This
is an example of a standard statement:
“We would like to give the Researchers information – such as whether you are male or
female, your age, your race and information about health-related issues, including
information such as your history of smoking, current medical or surgical diagnosis or
previous medical treatments. Information that identifies you, like your name or address,
will not be given and will remain confidential” (Emory Front Door Consent).
If the consent for this research was standard, the PI has clearly contradicted a promise to the
donor made in the consent. The bedrock principle of research ethics that has been in place
since the Nuremberg Code, namely to only conduct research with patient consent, has been
broken. The student rightly identifies that she is in an ethical conundrum.
The question the student asks herself, however, is not the right one. She asks: should I
continue using this tissue? It is no wonder she is perplexed by this question, for as an
investigator deeply involved in the research, she is not the right one to determine the proper
response. We have found through decades of unfortunate experiences that the investigator
alone should not be expected to answer difficult research ethics questions pertaining to their
work. Instead, in the United States, we have developed patient and investigator protection
systems. These are run by entities removed from and presumably not biased by their
participation in the research, charged with making these important ethical decisions. In this
case, the entity that should make the decision is the respective institution’s Institutional Review
Board (IRB). The student may have witnessed both a protocol and consent violation, and the
IRB must be notified of both. We do not underestimate how difficult this is for a student when 
the violator is her PI. Many institutions have ombudsmen or ethics consult services that can
help a student navigate this difficult situation and navigate means of reporting potential
violations. Here, only an unbiased group, like an IRB, should make the final determination of
whether or not the identified sample can be used.
In addition to investigating the specific violation, the IRB can investigate the system
failure and culture that allowed for this violation to occur. If the PI knows this sample donor’s
identity, the system in place to protect confidentiality appears to be flawed. This system of
protecting confidentiality must be corrected before any tissue research can continue. A flawed
system of respecting the parameters of confidentiality undermines the informed consent that is
so painstakingly obtained for samples. Moreover, the student has uncovered a serious
organizational ethics problem. Though it is not the student’s responsibility to solve this
problem, it is their responsibility to notify the entity within the organization that has the power
and expertise to address this problematic practice.
In sum, should the student use the sample? The ultimate decision should be made by
unbiased body who, after serious ethical reflection, decides how best to protect this donor as
well as go forward with what may be research that is impactful to many. It is very unlikely that
this deliberation will conclude that the student can proceed: with knowledge of the donor’s
identity and personal information about the donor’s sample, the student will be unable to
disassociate the personal information from the identified donor. Having this knowledge without
consent and continuing work will be an assault on the donor’s privacy. If, however, the research
is important enough, it may be possible to transfer this line of research to another investigator
in such a way that the donor’s identity is once again concealed. A careful weighing of the risks
to the donor and the benefits to humanity must be accomplished and ultimately guided by a
careful IRB review.","%Introduction:

28,"My graduate thesis involved developing an assay to determine if light-activated
metalloporphyrins could kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the assay could validly and reliably
show significant bacterial cell death, then the compounds we were evolving would present a
possible alternative treatment for Pseudomonas infections, especially in burn patients.
Developing the assay, then, was key to finding a reliable way to test a large number of
candidate compounds and to identify the ones with the greatest lethality to the bacterium.
After developing and reworking various assays, I evolved a method for determining the
killing efficiency of light-activated metalloporphyrins that could be performed in duplicate or
triplicate in each trial. The first trial showed extensive bacterial cell death in all experimental
groups, but the second repetition showed little or no cell death. Much to my delight, a third
trial confirmed the results of our first trial.
At this point, I approached my advisor and requested permission to write my thesis with
these results. He felt, however, that we needed to obtain the same results in two consecutive
trials. Much to my surprise and dismay, a fourth and fifth trial showed no bacterial cell death.
Consequently, we could not verify the original results, and I began an extensive troubleshooting
process to determine if either the assay was defective or if the metalloporphyrins were
ineffectual bacteriocidal agents.
Further trials, which were time-consuming and laborious, nevertheless resulted in more
accurate data and, thankfully, prevented us from making embarrassingly inaccurate
conclusions. It also eliminated the need to test a large number of other candidate compounds
with an ineffective assay—which would have resulted in an even greater waste of time and
materials than simply repeating our experiment a few extra times. Consequently, I not only
took away from my thesis experience a better grasp of the scientific process, but an
understanding of the ethical importance of patience, verification, and the reporting of reliable
experimental data. ",This one does not have an expert opinion,"%Introduction:

29,"Some years ago I was completing my undergraduate degree and was working in Dr. Allen’s lab. I very much wanted to go on to graduate school and was looking to my project—a fairly sophisticated one I was doing with a post-doc—to get me admitted to the graduate program I had in mind. I was also counting on Dr. Allen, who was pretty well known in the field, to write me a nice letter of recommendation. Unfortunately, my project yielded no significant data. I wasn’t terribly bothered by this as I felt the results were still reportable—maybe even, given the nature of the research, “significant” in a nonstatistical way. Dr. Allen, however, could not have disagreed more. He said I would have to write a report on this project and that he wouldn’t have a report coming out of his lab with no statistically significant findings. He told me to go on a “fishing expedition” and perform a bunch of ad hoc analyses in the hopes of finding some correlations that were statistically significant. Because I was taking a statistics course at the same time, I knew what Dr. Allen was asking me to do was experimentally unsound and, therefore, unethical. What a dilemma: I needed to turn in the report to graduate, and I needed Dr. Allen’s letter of recommendation. If I questioned him on it, I was afraid he’d throw me out of his lab. I talked to my post-doc for advice, and she agreed that the fishing expedition, also termed “data torturing,” was unsound. But she wouldn’t go to Dr. Allen on my behalf. So, I decided not to make any waves. I managed to find a few correlations that were statistically significant, wrote my report, and graduated with a letter of recommendation from Dr. Allen. I rationalized the whole thing by thinking, “Who was I to be questioning someone who had been doing research for so many more years than I?” Also, Dr. Allen never struck me as a devious person. I strongly suspect he didn’t think there was anything wrong with the fishing expedition. Of course, the primary reason I went along was fear of retaliation and damage to my career prospects. I’d imagine there are many individuals who can relate stories similar to mine. What should institutions do to prevent this kind of thing from happening?","Why is data torturing ethically problematic? In a word, because neither the reported data nor
the explanations or hypotheses the data torturer offers are all that trustworthy. As James Mills
explained in a now classic 1993 article, either the data have been manipulated to fit a preferred
or favored hypothesis or, as in the reported case above, the investigator “pores over the data
until a ‘significant association’ is found between variables and then devises a biologically
plausible hypothesis to fit the association..”
So, as in the above example, the
investigator generates a post-hoc or a posteriori hypothesis to explain correlations that may or
may not be generated by chance, even though they have been determined statistically
significant at the P value of 0.05. (A P value of 0.05 means that there is a 5 percent chance that
a reported difference occurring between two groups was actually due to chance (making it a
false positive finding) or, alternatively, that there is a 95 percent chance that a reported
difference between two groups is real and not due to chance.)
In the above case, both the data eventually selected for comparison as well as the
hypothesis forwarded to explain their associations are more created than experimentally
derived. Neither were experimentally planned or resulted from a primary hypothesis, which
explains why this kind of data manipulation is sometimes referred to as a “fishing expedition”—
one never knows what he or she will find.
One might object, though, that if the findings—no matter which—correlate at a P value
of 0.05, then significance is significance and no harm is done. But such an objection obscures
what usually occurs on the fishing expedition. Typically, what “opportunistic” (as Mills calls
them) data torturers do is first generate dozens of categories or subgroups and then survey
their associations or co-occurrences. But if one is analyzing dozens if not hundreds of such
possible associations, certain ones might indeed demonstrate a P value less than 0.05 but only
because no statistical adjustments were made for the multiple comparisons. In other words,
the more one creates subgroups so that one can keep generating comparisons among them,
the more one improves the chance that some of these associations will satisfy the P value of
0.05. But of those that do, one will not know which co-occur because of chance (i.e., due to all
the comparisons) or which correlations are real, i.e., would be replicated by additional
experiments. Mills’s explanation of this deserves a lengthy quotation:
[A]n honest exploratory study should indicate how many comparisons were made…most
experts agree that large numbers of comparisons will produce apparently statistically
significant findings that are actually due to chance. The data torturer will act as if every
positive result confirmed a major hypothesis. The honest investigator will limit the
study to focused questions, all of which make biologic sense. The cautious reader
should look at the number of ‘significant’ results in the context of how many
comparisons were made.(p. )
Nevertheless, Mills’s observations were not universally accepted. Some months after his article
appeared, Douglas Dix complained that some of the greatest discoveries of the modern era
(e.g., Einstein’s quantum theory, Mendelian genetics, the structure of the double helix) were
generated in precisely the a posteriori fashion that Mills repudiates.
Indeed, one might say
that the experiments to be conducted at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, Switzerland,
which will examine collisions of sub atomic particles, is yet another instance of data in search of
a theory.
However, a glaring difference between the data torturing in the above example and the
Mendelian/Quantum/Double Helix/Hadron Collider examples is that the former was done in
apparent desperation, while the latter look to a long history of scientific inquiry, the plausibility
of whose aims and rationales were under constant development, scrutiny and investigation.
Indeed, in the above example, we have no antecedent notion of which data we’re looking for.
All we know is that we are looking for correlations that are statistically significant and around
which we will try to fashion some kind of hypothesis that one hopes is scientifically plausible.
None of this occurs against an historical background of a community of scientists doing
hypothesis testing, data accumulation, analysis of data trending, public discussions at
professional forums or in professional publications, and so forth. In the above example, Dr.
Allen seems more interested in maintaining the reputation of his lab than in advancing the
cause of generalizable knowledge. The data torturer is mostly trying to get away with his or her
professional respectability intact.
Since Mills’s article appeared, clinical trials are especially set up rigorously with specified
questions and measurable end-points listed before the trial begins. Primary publications report
mainly, if not exclusively, on this data. They may report some subgroup analyses, but clinical
research has become very strict in clearly reporting any subgroup analyses as such, and not
recommending treatment decisions based on subgroup data only. This is not to say that
subgroup analyses are inherently bad. They often suggest new hypotheses and form the bases
for a new clinical trial. In fact, they have opened up the field of ""individualized"" treatment
where, for example, breast cancer patients are now treated based on specific features of the
tumor and the patient. But this only became possible with carefully constructed prospective
trials of the subgroups, which is the only way to ensure statistically significant results. Indeed,
the FDA does not approve drugs based only on subset analyses, but requires prospective
randomized trials.
Returning to the above dilemma, we believe it would have been acceptable if the report
included the methods and results of this fishing expedition and suggested that perhaps a
somewhat different hypothesis (or a different experimental design) might fit both the
suggestive data resulting from testing the original hypothesis and also the statistically
significant results teased out of the data by this fishing expedition and how they were found.
The writer would be ethically bound to report why the results of the fishing expedition should
be taken with caution and were not the result of an experiment carefully designed to ensure
that they are trustworthy. But the dilemma contributor was directed by Dr. Allen to come up
with a modified, after the fact hypothesis that would fit the statistically significant correlations
and to misrepresent that this was the hypothesis that they were testing all along.
This is ethically troublesome, because by misrepresenting the process, the report
contributes to a false understanding of the way 1) science proceeds, 2) the likelihood of success
in connection with any one experiment, and 3) the challenges of formulating a hypothesis and
designing an experiment that yields unambiguous results. This tainting of the “process data”
ripples through the scientific community in a way that generates false expectations of students,
research funders, scientists themselves, and the public. It contributes to a vicious cycle of
motivation and temptation to do as was done here, which, in turn, encourages the reporting of
results that are not properly qualified and hence untrustworthy and undermines the pursuit of
scientific “truth.”
In conclusion, here are some of Mills’ recommendations for assessing allegedly
statistically significant findings :
Did the reported findings result from testing a primary hypothesis or an a posteriori
hypothesis?
Does the hypothesis have good supporting data from previous studies? Does it use
theoretical insights and an examination of previously reported data?
Have data been reported for all groups in the study or were certain study groups
excluded from analysis and why?
Is the reported finding consistent across a wide range of values, or does it only apply to
a selected group and none of the rest?
Are the cutoff points for laboratory studies reasonable and justifiable or are they
selected because they allow the results to be significant?
Was the effect of multiple comparisons discussed and statistically managed?
How many significant results were reported relative to the number of comparisons
made?
Was the research outcome defined before collecting the data?
A final point: If there are many ways to understand a study’s reported findings, there are
probably many ways to tweak or “torture” the data.

30,"Deleting data points is hardly uncommon. You print out all the data points on a scatter plot,
and then see that there are a few points way over in left field (or lower right field) or anywhere
but where they should be. This is such a familiar situation in research that statisticians have
actually worked out strategies that describe how to delete these “funky” data.
This would imply that there are certain situations in which the practice is OK. But there
are clearly instances where such deletion amounts to misrepresentation. What are the
boundaries or criteria that distinguish ethical from unethical deletion of data?","It is true that excluding data points is an acceptable practice, but only under certain conditions.
For example, if the data points are known to represent gross errors or if they reflect impossible
values, they can be deleted. There are also statistical procedures that can be performed to test
for outliers, based on how extreme the data values are relative to the rest of the data.
Outliers can be influential or not influential. In other words, they can be far removed
and inconsistent with the rest of the data or be far removed but consistent with the rest of the
data. In the former case, one can do summarization and analysis of the data both with and
without the outliers because the inferences and conclusions are different with and without the
outliers. In the latter case, separate analyses with and without the outliers are similar and not a
problem. That is, in the latter case, the outliers have little effect on inferences
and conclusions. Nevertheless and in either case, all outliers must be reported. To do
otherwise, would be scientific fraud.
Obviously, when data deletion changes the results of the study or misrepresents the
study, the act is unethical. David Resnik has called it an act of dishonesty, meaning that it is
intentional deception.
 (When X deceives Y, X intentionally misrepresents an idea, or a fact, or
a belief such that Y forms a false or inaccurate impression of it.)
One can envision two ways that deception occurs through the deletion of data points.
Upon looking at an “enhanced, data deleted” image of a scatter plot, the reader might believe
that the data has magnificently confirmed the investigators’ hypothesis—when is not the case.
A second form of deception occurs when the reader is led to believe that the research design
and execution were, according to the data points, flawless. Needless to say, both of these false
impressions are intended not to further the ends of research but to further the investigators’
self- interest, e.g., to make the publication more publishable, to garner honor or admiration for
the investigators’ research technique, etc.
Resnick also points out that readers of the report might have an interest in knowing
whether a data set contains outliers, perhaps because they contemplate doing the same
experiments. Indeed, the replicability of any experiment ought to make investigators think
twice about deleting data points, as they might be challenged to reproduce their results.
Deception in data reporting is a remarkably reprehensible act. It dishonors science and
scientists (from whom we expect the truth; anyone, scientist or not, can lie and deceive); it
dishonors the investigators’ institution—which technically “owns” the data so that the act of
misrepresentation blemishes, by extension, the reputation of the institution; and to the extent 
that the data might someday be implemented in a clinical trial involving human subjects, it
might prove harmful to them.
Consequently, investigators who are blasé about deleting data points have probably not
thought through their moral obligations as scientists nor the possible consequences their
deception might someday wreak on research participants.

31,"Jack and Jill are graduate students, working at the same university but in different labs.
They are friends and frequently discuss their projects, which are often along similar
lines. One day, Jill tells Jack about her progress and discloses a lot of details about her
experimental design and data. However, she mentions to Jack that she has gotten stuck
and can’t move forward because her lab doesn’t have the resources to move her work
along. Jack, as it turns out, is not only very interested in Jill’s work, but his lab is well
supported, and his professor likes him and would support Jack’s ideas. Without telling
Jill, Jack spends the next few months working out his own version of Jill’s experiment
with great support from his advisor. He then publishes an important paper which Jill
had no idea about until she sees it appear in a high impact journal.
Perhaps one can argue that Jack did not steal Jill’s work because he did not
include any of Jill’s data in his paper. But was it ethical of him to dismiss Jill’s
contribution altogether since Jack’s work derived totally from Jill’s original conceptual
design and ideas? His experimental design was entirely Jill’s and was inspired by Jill’s
preliminary work.
Should Jack at least have acknowledged Jill’s contribution at the end of his
paper? Should he have included her as an author? Should he have suggested
collaborating with her from the start?","So, the ethical suspicion is that Jack has stolen or plagiarized Jill’s “ideas” or her
intellectual property. In legal point of fact, though, Section 102 of the copyright law,
title 17, United States Code, says that ideas, methods or systems are not subject to
copyright protection:
In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to
any idea, procedure, system, method of operation, concept, principle or
discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated,
or embodied in such work.
One can argue that from a legal perspective, Jill gave up the secrecy or ownership of her
work when she disclosed certain of its details to Jack. Still, Jack’s behavior hardly seems
professional, and his university might indeed have rules that Jack violated (about which
we will say more later). But let’s first examine some issues or try to answer some
questions that can inform an ethical opinion.
For instance, how far along was Jill in her project? This question is worth asking
because according to one influential theory of “property,” namely John Locke’s, one
acquires a property interest according to the labor he or she invests in the project.
Although Locke was thinking about land ownership when he wrote about property, we
could easily apply his “labor mixing” principle to Jack and Jill’s situation. If Jill had not
devoted much effort to her project, had only a very half-baked idea of it, and was simply
trying out some experimental approaches, we might not accord her much ideational
“ownership” such that Jack’s behavior would not seem egregious. But apparently Jill 
was at least well enough along so that Jack could appropriate her original conceptual
design and method and run with it. On the Lockean account, then, Jill should be able to
make a serious moral claim that it was unethical or unprofessional of Jack to take her
idea wholesale and give her no credit whatsoever. In fact, if Jill’s conceptual design
benefited from the input of others in her lab (and there’s a good chance it did), then
Jack appropriated that collective effort, not just Jill’s, for his own benefit.
There’s another, utilitarian reason, why Jack’s behavior was unprofessional. In
addition to Locke’s labor-mixing theory of property, utilitarians believe that protecting
property rights is conducive to creating “greater happiness for the great number” or
that property rights promote the overall social good. David Resnik has pointed out that
utilitarians can applaud intellectual property rights according to the way those rights
“maximize social utility by providing authors and inventors (and entrepreneurs and
investors) with incentives and rewards which encourage the development of science,
technology, industry and the arts.”
 My knowing that my intellectual work will be
protected as mine and credited to me is a motivating force, such that I will be more
likely to turn out deliverables that have social value than if intellectual property rights
did not exist.
One would think that universities would recognize the same and expect all their
investigators to be more inclined to collaborate and respect one another’s intellectual
property rather than “scoop” one another. Consider, for example, the situation at “DogEat-Dog University” where investigators are always on the prowl to steal one another’s
work or novel ideas. It’s easy to imagine how investigators there would hesitate to
discuss their projects with anyone inside (or outside) their laboratories—and thus would
be entirely unable to take advantage of the collective knowledge of their peers.
Consider how the dog-eat-dog ideology would have a chilling effect on investigator
morale, collegiality, productivity, and professional respect. Obviously, Jill thought she
could trust Jack’s honoring her intellectual property because they work at the same
university that would expect and want them to share ideas. Had Jack been employed at
a competitor university, Jill probably wouldn’t have been nearly as forthcoming because
she knew she might be risking Jack’s making off with her ideas.
While ideas are not legally protected (because it is practically impossible to
prove one’s ideas as original or novel), respecting another’s right to his or her ideas as
intellectual property is critical in certain scientific situations. If researchers invited to
the NIH to review research proposals didn’t honor the confidentiality of those
proposals—i.e., if, as soon as they could, they’d run back home to their labs with ideas
they pilfered from those proposals—or if journal reviewers didn’t honor the
confidentiality of the papers they review for possible publication, the engine of research
and its dissemination would come undone.
So we suggest that Jack’s behavior was antithetical to the kind of relational
atmosphere in scientific institutions that encourages collaboration for the sake of
superior morale and heightened productivity. Indeed, at least one institution would
categorically indict Jack’s behavior as plagiarism (and a violation of the honor code)
because plagiarism is defined there as “any person who uses a writer’s ideas or
phraseology with giving due credit.”
Once Jack realized he might be able to take Jill’s experiments forward, he should
have consulted with her and his lab director and negotiated a work plan that would
have respected, through authorship attribution or at least an acknowledgement at the
end of the article, Jill’s original contributions. As the situation now stands, Jill might
proceed with a complaint against Jack, whereupon both of them will experience the
unpleasantries of an institutional inquiry. Indeed, one might argue that Jill has an
obligation to report Jack's professional and ethical misconduct to her lab director as well
as to Jack’s. To ignore the issue, even if it results in ""the unpleasantries of an
institutional inquiry,"" would arguably undermine the integrity of the
institution. Transparency and support for reporting unprofessional conduct is crucial
to any profession. Had Jack and Jill worked together early on, perhaps on multiple
papers with each one as first author, the outcome would likely have been much more
favorable.

32,"A basic scientist temporarily discontinued the development of a measles treatment after the approval of a
highly effective measles vaccine. However, due to the anti-vaccine movement as well as logistical
barriers in underserved countries, it has become clear that the vaccine will not achieve global eradication.
Therefore, given the current measles epidemic, the scientist has decided to resume efforts towards the
development of the investigational treatment and submit a grant. His plan is to first conduct a phase 1
clinical trial in healthy adults and then to proceed to a phase 1 trial in children with measles. Since one of
the few places that children regularly get measles is in developing countries such as India, he would like
to conduct the pediatric trial in India. He is proposing a trial that raises three ethical concerns: (1)
measles, though it can have long term adverse events such as reduced hearing, is not usually fatal so the
risk/ benefit analysis is not easy; (2) he wants to do a trial in sick individuals in the pediatric setting; (3)
he wants to do the trial in India. The requestor asked for this research consult to help with writing a grant
to fund the clinical trial.
Background:
In 2018, globally, there were 9,759,400 cases of measles, with nearly 140,000 deaths1
. These statistics
demonstrate that there is a current measles epidemic that needs to be addressed. Even in the United States,
a first-world country in which the measles was declared eradicated in 2000, cases have been on the rise
due to travel and transmission to unvaccinated individuals2
. The United States reported 1,282 cases in
2019—the highest since 19923
. However, the majority of cases are found in poorer countries who have
limited access to the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccines, with the most recent CDC report showing
India leading the world with the highest number of cases during a one-month period4
. Limited access to
the vaccine in third-world countries contributes to these high statistics5 and highlights that despite the fact
that a vaccine exists for measles, the current rise in cases demands a treatment that can help mitigate the
effects of this deadly and debilitating disease. ","What is the benefit/risk analysis for a measles treatment?
While measles only causes death in 1-3 cases per 1000 individuals
, the potential adverse events that can
occur in both the short-term and long-term indicate that a potential measles treatment may likely provide
significant benefit. Contracting measles can cause pneumonia and encephalitis, permanent brain damage,
secondary infections, blindness or hearing loss. Studies have also revealed that there are long-term
risks associated with contracting the measles. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal
disease of the central nervous system and fatal neurological complications are but two of those risks.
Additionally, the CDC noted that 20% of cases in the United States resulted in hospitalization, especially
among children under the age of 5 and adults over the age of 20
. Therefore, although measles is not
usually fatal, an effective treatment could limit the adverse events caused by contracting measles, leading
to immense benefits for the survivor.
Ethics of Pediatric Trials
In light of the fact that measles is most commonly contracted in childhood, a pediatric trial appears to be
appropriate, but raises ethical concerns as children are a vulnerable population and do not have the
capacity to consent. The FDA’s categories of acceptable research in pediatrics requires the study to
“present risks that are justified by anticipated direct benefits to the child (21 CFR 50.52;45 CFR 46.405).”
Therefore, the researcher must have adequate data on both the benefits and risks of the investigational
treatment. To get this data, we recommend that the research team first conduct a trial with healthy adult
individuals and then if possible, the research team should try to conduct a small trial in adults with
measles. However, since measles is predominantly a pediatric disease, if it is not possible to conduct a
trial with infected adults, it is imperative that an animal model be used to establish the prospect of direct
benefit as well as to assess any possible risk, in addition to the data from healthy adults. If the
investigational treatment shows to be effective in the animal models and safe within both the human adult
and animal trial, then the investigational treatment may offer direct benefit to child participants, satisfying
the FDA’s qualifications for pediatric trials. Once meeting this criterion, we suggest that the research
team do an age escalation, if possible, starting with older adolescents before including younger children,
as older adolescents are more capable than younger children of providing meaningful assent.
Ethics of International trials
Conducting a clinical trial in a developing country is only ethical if six principles are respected. These
principles include: collaborative partnership, social value, scientific validity, fair selection of subjects,
favorable risk/benefit ratio, independent review and informed consent
. Many of these principles will be
met by the trial design and implementation as planned, but three of them need further consideration:
collaborative partnership, social value and fair selection of subjects. First, we recommend that the
research team partner with a community in India that is directly impacted by the current measles
epidemic. We suggest the research team collaborate with community leaders in order to determine the
community need and interest for this investigational measles treatment. If there is a community need and
the researchers choose to open the trial, the team must ensure they respect the community partner’s
culture and social values, soliciting advice from the community leaders’ on how best to conduct the study
in their community and how to fairly select subjects. If the investigational treatment is proven to be
effective, the research team must ensure that they have the resources needed to make this treatment
available to this community after the research project is completed. Through proper community
engagement, this proposed trial can respect all the principles for ethical conduct of international trials.
Summary:
While there is an ever-growing need for an effective measles treatment, this proposed trial raises
significant ethical concerns. In order to ensure the trial is ethically sound, it is imperative that the
researchers gather enough animal and healthy adult data to ensure that there is a good risk/benefit ratio for
a pediatric trial and that they collaborate closely with the Indian partner community where they will
conduct the research.

33,"This dilemma, which is a not uncommon one, involves the risks and benefits of
expediting approval for a promising drug.
Some years ago, I worked at a pharmaceutical company and was involved in
Phase III cancer trials among patients whose disease had returned. These patients had a
poor prognosis, but a drug we were working on showed that the median survival rate
among the (small group of) patients on the new drug was increased by 5 months. A
press release and journal article were prepared and, very rapidly, patient advocacy
groups began demanding access to the drug prior to FDA approval.
Once a Phase III trial is completed with results that show sufficient efficacy for
FDA approval, it often takes 6 months to 1 year to complete a filing package for the FDA
to review, followed by a year before the FDA rules on the drug. So, at a minimum it
would take 18 months for approval, meaning that patients who were currently being
diagnosed with cancer relapse would probably not be alive when or if the drug
appeared. The question therefore was: Could this process be expedited without the loss
of data integrity?
While the consequence of routine filing time to desperate patients is obvious, a
shortened filing for the pharmaceutical company can mean the loss of data that might
be necessary for approval and that could bolster (or diminish) the validity of the efficacy
claims. The consequences to the FDA were that taking too long to have the drug
approved can look very unsympathetic to the patients who need it, while taking too
short a time could potentially put an unsafe drug on the market.
Obviously, both the FDA and the pharmaceutical company have legal obligations
to ensure that the drug was reasonably safe and effective. But they also have a moral
obligation to provide the medication as rapidly as possible to patients. What kinds of
considerations, therefore, need to occur in order to achieve the best of both ethical
obligations?","Weighing the risks and benefits of a prescription drug is a complex process, made all the
more difficult by time and monetary restraints on the process. In an ideal moral
universe, the patient with the help of a compassionate, very informed physician, would
be able to understand reliable, sufficiently and carefully gathered scientific data and
make his or her own decision with a minimum of governmental intrusion. But the real
world we live in and take drugs in is quite different.
Pharmaceutical research begins with laboratory investigations, largely funded by
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that seek to identify a biophysiological site or
locus for therapeutic intervention. Candidate drugs or biologics are identified and tried.
Through complex relationships between the NIH, academic institutions, and industry,
the drug is investigated further. A patent on the drug may be issued sometime during
this process. Testing in humans usually begins only after a patent is obtained and is, by
law, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical trials, once designed
and carried out solely in academic centers, are now often conducted by Contract
Research Organizations (CRO’s), which are for-profit companies set up to carry out trials
for the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA convenes scientific advisory boards to make
recommendations, and then decides to approve, disapprove, or require more data on
the drug. Expedited approval, with an extra user’s fee paid by the drug maker, can be
obtained in special situations. The FDA is also responsible for product labeling and
warnings.
Once approved, the new drug’s maker enjoys a long period of protection from
competition—usually 20 years—provided that trials and approval were expeditious and
did not eat up a large part of the patent protection time. Post-approval safety oversight
is also a mandate of the FDA. Indeed, a case currently before the US Supreme Court
(Wyeth v. Levine) is seeking to restrict lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies if the
drug has been approved by the FDA.
Informed, ethical people can disagree on whether 18 months or 12 months is the
best time limit for FDA approval. But what looms over all this is the fact that persons
who are desperate, such as the ones contemplated in this scenario, might very well
accept a drug whose evidentiary showing per efficacy and safety is very, very low (e.g.,
modest evidence from animal models). Needless to say, these individuals would
nevertheless be very vulnerable towards the marketing of a drug that might actually
have only minimal claim to be taken seriously.
A recent case that demonstrates these concerns is Abigail Alliance for Better
Access to Developmental Drugs v. Von Eschenbach. Abigail Alliance was founded by
Frank Burroughs, whose 19 year-old daughter Abigail did not meet inclusion criteria for
an oncologic trial. (She later entered a trial for another drug shortly before her death.)
What Abigail Alliance would like to see is the current FDA approval process for
terminally ill patients largely dissolved or considerably attenuated. Whereas the
scenario here contemplates Phase III trials, Abigail Alliance would like to see terminally
ill persons be able to access drugs that are in Phase I trials and that “government get out
of the way, so that they (i.e., patients) can use their own private resources to fight for
their own lives at the inherently uncertain frontiers of modern science.” (p. 207 of
Jacobson and Parmet)
For Abigail Alliance, the issues are not only beneficence and maleficence, but our
country’s evolving a largely unregulated pharmaceutical marketplace that can
accommodate a certain group of consumers who, calling upon their autonomy and
justice rights, wish to make their own purchasing decisions. This would inevitably allow
pharmaceutical manufacturers greater opportunity to market unapproved medications.
Abigail Alliance based its legal case on a fundamental right, arguably protected
by the privacy and due process clauses of the 5th Amendment. In early 2008, the case
was resolved when the US Supreme court declined to hear it, leaving the DC appellate
court decision, which said that patients have no right to “a potentially toxic drug with no
proven therapeutic benefit” standing. In the meantime, commentators watching the
case found a number of things to worry about had Abigail Alliance won.
A very serious worry would be that if terminally ill patients could have access to
new but unproven drugs, they would almost certainly not want to enroll in randomized
trials but just purchase the drug (because they wouldn’t want to chance being
randomized into the control arm of the trial). This would not only seriously compromise
the possibility and scientific value of clinical trials, but it could profoundly skew outcome
data: Patients who are terminally ill and who have exhausted conventional therapies
might be too sick for the unproven drug to do any good. Thus, a trial that does not
control for participant acuity might show poor results when, in a less sick population,
the drug might show better outcomes.
There is also the matter of patients hectoring their physicians for drugs that are
not adequately proven. Would this create a liability situation for the physician? What
about the pharmaceutical manufacturer? Notice that if Abigail Alliance succeeded in its
lawsuit, the pharmaceutical manufacturer might still be wary of making an unproven
drug available because of litigation concerns. But on the other hand, the manufacturer
might be eager to make the drug available per its perceived profit potential. Thus, an
additional concern would be regulating the price the manufacturer charges especially
early on, when the opportunity to reap huge profits will be considerable.
As mentioned above, the context of Abigail Alliance was access to Phase I trials,
not Phrase III as contemplated by the dilemma contributor. Still, if the concern is about
“unproven” pharmaceuticals, then the above worries remain relevant although they are
somewhat tempered by a drug’s having progressed to Phase III. In that latter regard, it
appears we have two ethical issues: 1) selecting an evidentiary threshold for safety and
efficacy that is morally reasonable, and 2) recognizing as a matter of justice that the
FDA’s approval time is possibly prolonged by the institution’s being underfunded—an
criticism that is commonly made. And while it is true that physicians can always file an
application for “compassionate use”—if no comparable treatment alternative exists;
clinical trials are underway; and FDA approval is being sought—manufacturers often
don’t like to accommodate compassionate use requests because they are concerned
about litigation and can’t profit from it.
Susan Okie has suggested a strategy that seems particularly applicable to the
case under consideration: The FDA might allow pharmaceutical companies to sponsor
large, nonrandomized, open-access trials for certain drugs. These trials would be run in
tandem with traditional, randomized trials such that they would allow greater access
while the participants’ experiences would be duly recorded in a registry. But because
this strategy would reintroduce the fear that patients would flock to these open label
trials, criteria should be in place to insure the integrity of the data and promote safety.
Such criteria might stipulate that:
1) access to the medications is only available through physicians working in an
affiliated oncology trial group;
2) potential enrollees have their diagnostic data reviewed through the physician
group and have their staging confirmed;
3) appropriate monitoring of the drug’s effects would be recorded by project
affiliated labs.
Again, payment and liability issues would have to be decided. Also, conflicts of interest
would need to be carefully monitored. Note that the university researcher is under
stress to publish positive results and bring in outside money for his own career
advancement. The pharmaceutical company has an explicit obligation to maximize
profits for its shareholders. Patient advocacy groups are often underwritten by drug
companies and so can be conflicted. The taxpayers who fund the FDA want their taxes
as low as possible. The politicians who control the FDA’s mandate and budget are
beholden to their constituencies and the pharmaceutical industries that fund their
elections. The insurance companies that pay for the drugs want to limit their price and
use. The patient and his physician want the best treatment available as fast as possible.
While the process inevitably calls for a complex balancing of competing ethical
principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice, if the process is tainted, the
result will surely be ethically problematic. Conflict of interest policies need to be
carefully considered and ethically managed; the FDA needs to have adequate funding to
carry out its enormous obligations; government representatives need to be held
accountable for ensuring that a transparent, ethical process is in place for drug
development, approval, and marketing; and, inevitably, investigators must place the
welfare of their participants at the very heart of their ethical obligations.

34,"Background: Improvements in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are progressively
being incorporated into both research and clinical practices, allowing rapid genetic diagnoses at a
cheaper cost. However, studies using NGS or whole-exome sequencing often encounter an ethical
dilemma in how to contact study participants in the case that they discover an incidental and medically
actionable finding. First, there must be a process for determining what to return and the means for
doing so. Secondly, such findings must be retested clinically to ensure valid results. The American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) suggests that clinical diagnostic laboratories that
perform either whole-exome or genome sequencing should report, at minimum, any positive result for
the 56 known pathogenic or expected pathogenic variant genes as incidental or secondary findings, even
when unrelated to the primary medical reason for testing.
Scenario: In a specific study, researchers were performing NGS on tissue banked samples of
healthy controls and colon cancer patients to validate an assay. The use of healthy controls in a study
like this is not uncommon; however, what happens if one of the healthy controls tests positive for a
mutation that predisposes to colon cancer using an unvalidated research assay? The samples were
obtained from a tissue bank and the researchers were unclear about what the informed consent stated
about returning incidental findings, raising the question whether to contact the subject and if contact is
attempted, how to do it.","Ethical Considerations: The growing ethical consensus is that medically actionable findings
should be returned, with an expert panel such as the ACMG determining which results are actionable.
The ACMG established the Secondary Findings Maintenance Working Group to create a process for both
forming and updating the list over time as our knowledge of genetic markers grows. In the case of
genes that may still predispose an individual to cancer but are outside of the ACMG’s 56 specific genetic
variants, the tissue bank protocol should include a mechanism for determining which incidentally
discovered variants should be returned and how. This should include giving the patient the option to
receive this information if discovered. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988
prohibits the return of individual research results to participants unless the results were obtained in a
CLIA-certified laboratory, which most research laboratories are not. Medically actionable findings
must therefore be confirmed in a CLIA-certified laboratory.
Another caution is that the researchers cannot assume that the donor will necessarily want to
know about the finding. Previous survey studies have shown that participants express diverse
preferences when it comes to learning of incidental findings in studies in which they participate.
However, most “agreed that individual choice and participation in the decision-making process were
critical.” Their rationale revolved around the fact that the findings directly affect those participating,
so they should have a say in information returned. The ACMG has released and kept up to date their
own recommendations for the analysis and return of secondary findings when any clinical genomic
analysis is pursued. Their suggestions include:
• Obtaining written informed consent by a qualified genetics health care professional regarding
the nature of the test
• Addressing the points like interpretive uncertainty, privacy, and impact on one’s family
• Informing the patient that laboratories will often analyze specific sets of genes that are deemed
to be highly medically actionable if discovered to be pathogenic variants, even when unrelated
to the primary medical reason for testing.
• Informing patients during consent that they may opt out of such analysis, but also that there
may be consequences in doing so.
• Applying the same policy to pediatric patients but allowing parents to opt out of such analyses
with the same follow up on possible ramifications of doing so.
• Applying this routine analysis of medically actionable genes deemed by the ACMG.
Expert Opinion: The above scenario is complicated because the cancer predisposing gene was
discovered on an experimental assay that had not yet been validated. However, there is still a potential
for finding a medically actionable finding in a CLIA certified lab. We therefore consider this case to be a
potentially medically actionable finding. We recommended that the study consent form for the healthy
participant be obtained and reviewed. Some consents offer the option not to be contacted in the case of
an incidental finding, in which case no further action should be taken. If return of results is mentioned in
the consent, the process outlined in the consent should be followed. If it is not mentioned in the
consent, the research team should consult experts to determine that the result is in fact medically
actionable. If it is actionable, and since the ethical consensus is now that patients/participants should
be informed about medically actionable findings, we advised the research group to attempt to contact
the provider who facilitated consent of the healthy control, who would in turn confer with the
participant and offer a consultation with a genetic counselor. If the participant agrees, after consultation
with a genetic counselor, a new sample could then be taken and tested in a CLIA approved lab.
Regardless of the research being conducted, any genomic/exome sequencing study that has the
possibility of unearthing an incidental finding should include a comprehensive consent allowing
participants the option to receive medically actionable findings, specifying the procedure to be followed
if such a finding is identified. The participant should also be warned that researchers are not directly
looking for such findings, but may return them if they do find them in the process of their research.

","%Introduction:  
The ethical dilemma surrounding the return of incidental findings in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies raises significant questions about participant rights, informed consent, and the responsibilities of researchers. As NGS technologies advance, the challenge of how to handle medically actionable findings becomes increasingly pertinent, particularly when the validity of the findings is uncertain.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the ethical obligation to return medically actionable findings, the necessity of confirming results in a CLIA-certified laboratory, and the diverse preferences of participants regarding the receipt of such information.

35,"A hospital is proposing the implementation of a concierge primary care practice, which provides patients with a breadth of healthcare services not covered by normal insurance. This model would require patients to pay $1500 to $3000 a year for access to a physician who will be a part of the concierge group at the institution. In addition, patients will receive comprehensive healthcare services, including 24-hour physician availability, expedited appointments, longer care visits, and preventive care not typically reimbursed by insurance. Physicians will be able to volunteer to treat patients on this service. While the hospital believes this model will offer high quality, comprehensive primary care services to its patients, they are faced with the dilemma of whether the model is ethically sound. Many hospitals offer a concierge model of primary care, but this group is concerned that they may contribute to large-scale health inequities, such as limiting access to primary care to those who cannot pay the extra fees or exacerbating the nationwide shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs).","This group is not alone in weighing the ethical pros and cons of concierge medicine. Concierge primary care is defined by the American College of Physicians as “any practice that directly contracts with patients to pay out-of-pocket for some or all of the services provided by the practice, in lieu of or in addition to traditional insurance arrangements, and/or charges an administrative fee to patients, sometimes called a retainer or concierge fee, often in return for a promise for more personalized and accessible care”. The first official concierge practice, MD^2, was established in 1996 in Seattle, Washington by Dr. Howard Maron and Dr. Scott Hall to provide higher quality care for a smaller panel of patients. In this practice, by paying a fee, patients are guaranteed a comprehensive, personalized care experience with access to an array of services not typically reimbursed by insurance. Concierge medicine poses ethical questions that must be adequately addressed before this group implements the model. This model has been criticized for exacerbating inequitable healthcare access on several fronts. First, when primary care physicians transition to practicing in the concierge setting, many are concerned it will leave patients who do not wish or are unable to pay the concierge fee without a PCP. The model has also been criticized for improving the quality of care for high-income individuals without making it accessible for all individuals, exaggerating class divisions in healthcare. Additionally, the concierge model may make it difficult for Medicare patients to enroll since Medicare does not cover the annual concierge fees, which may further alienate this already high-need patient population. Alternatively, other experts believe the model affords patients the opportunity to pay less on average than they would in a traditional care setting. Individuals with multiple chronic conditions, for example, could benefit from a concierge model given the annual fee may be less than their care may otherwise cost with regular insurance payment models. The American Medical Association (AMA) offers some guidance on the ethical establishment of a concierge practice and emphasizes that establishing such a practice is not inherently unethical. The patient’s decision to enroll in the concierge model must be voluntary, with the option to opt-out of the service at any time. Physicians must also present the terms of the practice, making the implications for the patient’s healthcare insurance clear, outlining which services will be covered in the new model. However, it should be noted that physicians are entitled to part ways with patients if they are in good health and their medical conditions are under control. The guidelines make clear that regardless of where PCPs practice, they must uphold their obligation of fidelity and to treat all patients with the same respect and quality of care. Experts also argue that a physician’s fiduciary responsibility to put the patient’s needs above their own may be compromised when PCPs are given the option to volunteer their services in the concierge model. Tempted by higher pay and smaller patient panels, PCPs may be drawn to this more manageable clinical environment. The American College of Physicians (ACP) issued guidelines for concierge practices in 2015, emphasizing that PCPs should not be ethically obligated to fix the PCP deficit, which was estimated at 17,222 PCPs in 2020, on their own, nor should they be pressured to continue practicing in a clinical environment that contributes to burn out. Instead, the ACP supports physicians to practice in an environment conducive to delivering ethical, quality healthcare. By allowing PCPs the option to work in a better environment, it may in fact diminish the shortage of PCPS by making it a more attractive specialty for physicians and helping to mitigate the high rates of PCP burnout. Recommendations Given the group is still in the early phases of implementation planning, we propose several recommendations to aid them in the ethical establishment of concierge medicine. First, to address the ethical concern of respecting all patients on the PCP’s current panel, we recommend the group thinks about how current patients may be affected in the transition to concierge services. For patients not interested in or not able to pay the concierge fee, their current PCP should make recommendations for a new PCP to aid the patient in a smooth transition of care to avoid patient abandonment. The group should be transparent about the pricing and services provided to ensure the ethical imperative of autonomy is upheld and patients can choose to participate or not participate based on good information. . To address the concern that concierge medicine can further exaggerate healthcare access disparities, we recommend the group promotes equitable access to the concierge services for those who wish to enroll by reducing financial barriers when possible and considers offering a sponsored or reduced membership fee. To account for the concern that concierge primary care exacerbates the PCP shortage, we recommend the group consider how the concierge practice will impact their institution directly: does the institution have a PCP shortage? If a shortage exists in their institution, we offer a few suggestions. The group could first implement a pilot concierge service to determine if the model exacerbates the issue or meaningfully contributes to providing quality primary care before scaling up the model. We also suggest the group be mindful about the number of PCPs they will allow to volunteer for the concierge services to reduce the risk of limiting the number of available PCPs at the institution. Finally, and most important, we suggest that the group implement quality metrics to ensure the same caliber of care is being provided in both the concierge and regular framework. To do so, we recommend the group references the institution’s mission and values, which may help to align the quality of care provided in both settings. If the group adequately considers these questions during their planning, we see no ethical objections to establishing such a model. Summary: Although it poses ethical questions about equitable access to care, the establishment of a concierge primary care practice is not inherently unethical. Regardless of the clinical environment, physicians have the responsibility to treat their patients with respect and to provide quality, ethical care. The group must consider how the new model my affect the surrounding community and their existing patients in order to devise an ethically sound plan. If neither the quality of care nor access to care are compromised in their proposed model, the group should feel comfortable moving forward in their planning process for the concierge clinic.

36,"I'm a pediatric oncologist who inherited a research project from a colleague. The project involved a one-time phlebotomy draw of 2 to 4 milliliters of blood from a pediatric population aged 3 to 21 years. These research participants are recruited from the regular patient population of our clinic who come for routine blood draws on their medical visits. The problem we encountered involved the work flow of our clinic. Before our patients arrived, I would review the list of who is coming in that day for regular clinic visits and decide if the patient was eligible for the blood study research project. Very frequently, however, and before I would see a newly arrived patient, a Tech would weigh the patient and draw blood per his or her routine visit. I usually had a very hard time catching the patient before the Tech did the blood draw, so I regularly found myself asking the patient and his or her family member for permission to be enrolled in the study that would then require the unpleasantness of a second venipuncture. Even when I did get to the patient before the Tech did, the informed consent conversation would be rushed and they would have to decide quickly if we could draw some extra blood. It then occurred to us that if we would simply draw an additional 2-4 milliliters of blood at the time of the Tech's routine blood draw, these problems would be solved. Once the blood is drawn and I subsequently see the patient, I could explain to the patient and his or her family member that we would use some of the blood that had just been taken. If they refused participation, we just wouldn’t use their blood in the study. This approach seemed much kinder to the patient in precluding the need for a second venipuncture; the patient and his or her family would not be delayed any further; and having already secured their blood, we thought it more likely that patients would consent to participating. The strategy seemed to present a clear win-win situation. Does it","This case presents us with a physician-researcher who is enrolling patients in a study that involves one-time blood draws. The research intervention, a venipuncture, seems very modest and can occur simultaneously with the patient's regular blood draw at his or her clinic visit. What might also seem a great moral comfort to the physician researcher is knowing that after having had an additional (but unconsented) 2-4 milliliters of blood taken with that routine draw, that extra blood will be discarded if the patient subsequently refuses to participate in the study when the formal consent process is broached. So, the patient's right of refusal is seemingly respected. Of course and like all researchers, this physician is under pressure to recruit a sufficient number of participants and doubtlessly believes in the value of his or her study. Given all these factors, it is easy to understand how the physician might justify the ""first poke, then hope"" enrollment strategy to his or her satisfaction. Nevertheless, these justifications do not trump the fundamental moral obligation to respect patient autonomy. While there may be a terrific temptation to succumb to the ""convenience factors"" of the non consented blood draw, those temptations must be stoutly resisted. One recalls John Rawls's famous statement on the first page of A Theory of Justice: ""Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override."" This moral intuition not only serves as the signal restraint on crude utilitarianism (i.e., acting so as to bring about as much satisfaction or happiness as possible for the greatest number of persons), it captures an appreciation of the ""otherness"" of the potential research participant that, in liberal, democratic societies, foregrounds his or her inviolability. No researcher, no matter how well intentioned, has a unilateral right to breach that otherness. By taking even the paltry amount of 2 to 4 milliliters of the patient's blood without consent, the researchers will have violated the individual's right to control what happens to his or her body. To excuse such a breach, no matter how modest, is to start a slide down a slippery slope whose terminus is the kind of mindset that was representative of our society's most acute ethical embarrassments in research with human participants. The ""inviolability"" factor might be especially easy to overlook in this case. Indeed, if the researcher in this case is also the patient's treating physician, he or she might feel extremely comfortable, even entitled, to do so as a derivative of his or her professional authority. Regardless of whatever relational comfort or informality that physician might already have established with previous patients, once they are approached as potential research subjects, their ethical status recalls a Rawlsian ""otherness"" with all the respect and dignity it deserves. There is an interesting sidelight to this case that persons familiar with blood draws will recognize. It is that even for routine, clinical blood draws, extra blood is usually taken. Standard lab practices vary, but saving blood samples for a day to a week is common for quality control or just keeping extra blood on hand until one is sure that the lab results are all right, e.g., are readable or if the data are unexplainably strange, extra blood is available for a repeat test. The standard practice, however, of taking enough blood for a lab test such that some of it is usually discarded does not preclude the ethical concern about the content of the patient's consent: that is, that patients having routine blood draws are consenting to blood analyses for clinical or health-related purposes. The purpose of having additional blood available remains consistent with a clinical, not research, objective to which the patient has consented. If all the patient's blood is not needed, as it usually isn't, then discarding what is left over would be ethically required if the patient hasn't consented to its use for the purposes of research. Interestingly, the customary drawing of more blood than is generally needed for clinical purposes suggests a ""neat"" resolution to this case: At the time when the researcher meets with the patient and or family to secure consent to the research study, he or she can explain to them the high probability that some of the blood drawn earlier could be used for the research study. That is, that a certain amount of blood is customarily left over from the lab analysis, but that the patient and or family would nevertheless have to consent to the analysis of that blood for research purposes. The downside of this strategy might be, however, that if the lab needs all the blood drawn earlier for clinical purposes, then implementing the lab analysis for research purposes will have to wait until the patient's next visit. Indeed, perhaps discussing the research project with the patient and family when they make their clinic visit but deferring the actual blood draw and the patient's formal consent until their next clinic visit is the best approach. While a downside of this strategy is its requiring some patience on the researcher's part, it would adequately acknowledge the patient's right (or the right of his or her surrogate) to formally and thoughtfully consent or refuse participation in the project. The time afforded to the patient and his or her family to contemplate research participation until the next clinic visit seems an ideal acknowledgment of the patient's autonomous right to participate or not. Nevertheless, the ""neat"" approach seems ethical as well: i.e., securing the patient's consent for research use of left over blood that was originally drawn for clinical purposes. Summary: Although it may seem convenient, taking blood without prior participant consent is not appropriate because it violates the potential participant's autonomy. A better approach is to discuss the research project and then either secure the participant's consent to use whatever blood is left over from the clinic visit for research purposes, or defer both the consent and blood draw until the next visit.

37,"We were conducting a pilot study in an area of the U.S. that had a large Hispanic population. I must emphasize that this was a “very” pilot project, funded entirely by our department. The data being gathered were extremely preliminary and would not benefit research participants in any way. In fact, it would probably be more correct to say that this was a “pre-pilot” study although it was approved by our IRB, of course. The problem occurred when Hispanic, would-be enrollees started showing up in our research offices without a consent form. This would occasionally happen because the informed consent translator would not be available, and the participants would be sent directly to research. But when that happened, we had no one available in the research unit to go over or “translate” the Spanish consent form into something the participants could understand. (Many of them were illiterate.) Because this became increasingly problematic, we decided to exclude Hispanics from the study altogether. A member of our research team was disturbed by this, however, saying that we were denying this population a possible “benefit.” Furthermore and intuitively, the wholesale exclusion of Hispanics certainly sounded discriminatory. I continue to wonder about this. Is there a right or a duty to participate in research? Was our exclusion of Hispanics in this study ethically defensible?","The recruitment of adequate and representative groups of trial participants can be extremely challenging. A 1984 study that is still quoted found that 34 percent of 41 randomized controlled trials in the U.S. recruited less than 75 percent of their planned samples. Recruitment problems are particularly acute among minority groups. A 2004 study by Murthy and colleagues found that Hispanics and Blacks were under-represented in National Cancer Institute (nonsurgical) treatment trials for breast, lung, colorectal or prostate cancer from 1996- 2002. The elderly were particularly under-represented, as they accounted for one-third of trial participants but represented two-thirds of patients with the cancers that were studied (i.e., breast, lung, colorectal and prostate). Another study noted that the consent process itself is a major barrier to recruitment. Assessing the level of information required by patients, discomfort over causing patients to worry about the nature of the trial, and mistrust among patients of the investigators’ motives are only some of the more representative problems of securing consent. One might respond to the scenario above with a “principled” approach or a more pragmatic one. A prominent tenet of a principled approach on research recruitment requires that investigators insure that the benefits and burdens of research participation are fairly distributed, such that the populations (or subgroups) of research participants mirror the population of end-users of the research. There are always burdens in participating in a research project, even if they only involve taking a few minutes out of one’s schedule, signing some papers, and answering some questions. On this view, excluding minorities might be seen as a moral failure among the investigators. Similar to more elaborate randomized studies where minorities are under-represented, this pilot has failed to insure that Hispanics shoulder their fair share of the research participation burden. A second principle-based argument would focus on depriving minorities of a benefit per the team member’s objection as above. While other team members believed that research participation “would not benefit the research participants in any way,” how does one define “benefit” in this scenario? We know that some persons believe that an obligation or duty to participate in research exists as everyone, sooner or later, benefits from it. Others are pleased to have the opportunity to exercise their altruism in helping their fellow human beings. In her systematic review of barriers to participation in randomized controlled trials, Ross noted that “in contrast to the barriers to participation, the most commonly mentioned motivation for participation was altruism.” Consequently, the investigators’ eliminating the opportunity among Hispanics to dispatch a duty or to gain satisfaction from exercising their altruism might be interpreted as morally problematic. A third principle-based argument might well complain that the decision to exclude “Hispanics” relies on the social construct of ethnicity/race rather than directly identifying the practical constraint that motivated the exclusion, namely, problems in translating the consent form to non-English speaking persons. Thus, when the researchers decided to exclude “Hispanics,” did they mean (1) persons biologically descended from people who once resided in Spain, or (2) persons for whom Spanish is their first language, including those whose parents moved from England to Venezuela before they were born, or (3) people who showed up “light brown, dark haired, and Spanish speaking”? Clearly, a more thoughtful and sensitive exclusion criterion would have been “persons who do not have 8th grade level literacy in English” rather than an omnibus ethnic category like “Hispanic,” even though the latter term happens to map roughly onto illiteracy in the geographical region of the study. The principled approach, then, would lament the decision to exclude Hispanics, and would probably urge that the sponsoring department find a few more dollars to hire an additional, Spanish-speaking investigator who could dissolve this problem. Nevertheless, those dollars might be hard to find, which invites a more pragmatic treatment of exclusion. Setting aside the question of whether minorities have a right or a duty to participate in research, a more practical problem is: Will the exclusion of Hispanics so contaminate the pilot’s findings that they will be worthless, especially by way of being nongeneralizable? And might that nongeneralizability imperil future persons who hail from populations that were initially excluded from enrollment? This latter possibility recalls the exclusion of women from cardiovascular pharmacologic studies for most of the 20th century. Although the drugs that succeeded in these trials and eventually came to market would be used by women, the fact that they were excluded from trial participation meant that investigators had no statistical confidence about the effectiveness and safety of these new medications among women. Indeed, there was speculation that women with heart disease were less likely to receive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures than men, presumably because of the failure among researchers to study and become familiar with the phenomenon of heart disease in women. As a result, the 1993 NIH Revitalization Act was passed such that, today, all NIH funded clinical research as well as phase III randomized controlled trials must include women and racial and ethnic minority groups in order to test the efficacy of a new treatment. At the cost of belaboring the point, we might also note that there is an overwhelming bias in American medical literature to understand white, Anglo males as the “norm” when, in fact, various internet sites note that northern European Caucasians probably account for less than 30 percent of the world’s population (with some sites speculating less than 10 percent). One might say, then, that the very group about which we have the most research data represents an inbred sub-clone. Arguing that African Americans or Hispanics are “different” misses the fact that “northern Europeans” represent an overstudied, inbred population that is hardly a representative sampling of human beings. (One might also relate this to the many psychological studies done solely on mostly white college undergraduates.) But if our concern is with representativeness, the pilot study described above is a long way from the kind of representativeness required in an NIH randomized trial. Let’s therefore consider some conditions under which exclusion might be pragmatically as well as ethically valid. What would one say, for example, about an fMRI study that purposely excluded lefthanded persons? Suppose the goal of the project was to discern the existence of a particular neural activation pattern, whose discovery would provide no immediate or foreseeable therapeutic benefit to anyone. However, its findings would be totally irrelevant to left-handed persons. Not only that, the inclusion of lefties would skew the data. Thus, it would be a waste of research monies and effort to enroll them. So, one could not seriously maintain a claim of “discrimination” in this project: Discrimination prevents a group from receiving a benefit to which they have a right. Here, there is no practical benefit that is being withheld from lefties; to include them would be a waste of time and money and sabotage the experiment. What about research that studies a socially important phenomenon occurring in certain populations but not in others, such as doing clinical research on diseases that particularly affect persons who are homeless or imprisoned? Here, the exclusionary methodology is morally justified on the basis of a widely-recognized need to understand the nature of health problems that only affect a particular group. The justification of exclusion rests on moral common sense: There is no need to include other populations in the study because they are not afflicted by the phenomenon being investigated. Consequently, it is crucial to know what this pilot study is about. Presumably, the essence of a pilot project is: to ensure that proposed methods and procedures will work in practice before being applied in a large, expensive investigation. Pilot studies provide an opportunity to make adjustments and revisions before investing in, and incurring, the heavy costs associated with a large study. So, we’ll assume that the point of the pilot project in the scenario above is to discern whether or not evidence exists that would support proceeding on to a more elaborate, pilot grant. On that basis, if there is utterly no physiological reason to think that excluding Hispanics would taint or corrupt its preliminary findings, and if those findings constitute only the very first, primitive step in what will be a more elaborate investigation later on—one that will certainly enroll representative subgroups of research participants—then the current exclusion of a particular population of potential enrollees might be marginally justifiable. We say “marginally” because a pragmatic approach would also note that a pilot project should provide knowledge or experience that enables that more serious, elaborate, and formal investigation later on to better anticipate, manage, and execute its performative challenges. Obviously, one finding from the pilot project above is that recruiting Hispanic participants will require a more elaborate informed consent protocol. But it is also quite possible that because Hispanics were excluded from the enacted pilot, investigators will face additional, unanticipated challenges in a later project. For example, the researchers don’t know how Hispanics will react to the informed consent materials and content of a later grant. Will they find the methodology incomprehensible or frightening? What kinds of questions will they ask? Will there be any culturally embedded resistance that Hispanics might have to the research objectives or methodology that will take the investigators by surprise? What barriers to the research participation of Hispanics might appear when a later grant begins that could have been uncovered by an earlier research experience that included them? In conclusion, if this pilot project is simply to determine the feasibility of a project idea that will be elaborated and refined further on, the exclusion of Hispanics seems mildly objectionable at most. (We anticipate that the investigators informed their IRB of the protocol change involving exclusion of Hispanics.) But if its data are going to be included and mentioned in a more formal pilot application seeking external funding later on, that application should at least describe the participant population studied, i.e., make clear that Hispanics were not included. Ironically, that future application might consider explicitly mentioning the challenges in securing consent from Hispanics, either to justify funding for a Spanish-speaking investigator and/or to point out that such a one will be in place so that minorities will be duly represented in the new project. In an odd way, noting the uncomfortable experience of failing to secure consent from an adequate sample of minority participants, and the subsequent measures being taken to insure that the problem does not reoccur might impress the reviewers of the future application and improve its chances of being funded.

38,"This dilemma occurred when I was completing my masters degree. I was collecting data in a very impoverished country, whose culture and language were immensely different from mine (i.e., the U.S). I signed onto the project shortly after the research proposal had been developed, funding was secured, and the protocol was vetted by both my university's IRB and the host country's. My job was to choose the site, recruit and retain subjects, and obtain baseline and endline blood samples. We experienced recruitment problems right away. Many of our participants were illiterate, and so had to have the consent form read and explained. Also, some distrusted us and thought we were there to harm them. At the study's end, it was necessary to collect blood samples. We had lost about 15 percent of the original sample for various reasons and therefore needed samples from all those still enrolled. I wasn't worried, though. I was confident we had assured those participants who might initially have had doubts about participating, and all the participants benefited from getting extra medical care and, often, free medicine. We also held ceremonies to honor and recognize them, and even had the study ""blessed"" by local religious heads. So, it was quite a surprise when only 50 percent of the participants arrived at our make-shift clinic for their final blood draw. In something of a panic, we decided that instead of waiting for them to come to us, we would take our equipment and go to their houses. If they did not want to give us a blood sample, they could tell us at their doorsteps. Did our strategy constitute an unacceptable level of coercion? I must say I wasn't entirely comfortable with it. Here we were, doctors and professionals in the field, arriving on their doorsteps with our lab coats on and all the equipment necessary to draw blood—wouldn't this make it harder for them to say ""No""? And if we did make it harder, were we then violating their right to be left alone and refuse participation (a right guaranteed them when they initially consented to participate)? In any event, the strategy worked. We were able to obtain enough samples to make our data credible. And after talking with other, more experienced researchers about blood sampling in other countries, I found that our strategy was not uncommon at all—that collecting enough data from certain nonwestern populations can be very difficult and that you do whatever is ethically reasonable to get the job done. In fact, we did have some participants deny our requests for a final blood draw, indicating that there was still ample opportunity for participants to withdraw. I nevertheless wonder whether our strategy crossed the ethical line of respecting our participants' right to refuse.","Let’s begin by identifying some factors in this case that might explain the dilemma contributor’s discomfort about the “home visit” blood draw strategy. First of all, most of the research participants in the study are impoverished and poorly educated. That very fact can make it seem that they are eminently exploitable and, hence, must be protected more keenly or aggressively than a population of research subjects who are well-educated and hail from economically well-off societies. Second, the participants are provided with free medicine and health care and are invited to ceremonies where they are honored. That might make it seem that the researchers are “bribing” them for their participation or at least that the researchers are creating a “gift relationship” such that the participants will feel pressured to participate when they’d prefer not to. A third source of the dilemma contributor’s feelings of moral guilt might involve the realization that the participants are vastly culturally different from the investigators. That realization might cause some of the investigators to question whether the participants could really give informed consent to the study at all, as the western notion of consent, its trappings, and western science in general might be hopelessly alien, even meaningless to them. In other words: No wonder they don’t want to participate. Altogether then, this trio of concerns might explain the dilemma contributor’s unease that the research team’s visiting the participants’ houses to collect data was morally overboard. Zeke Emanuel and his colleagues participating in Project Phidisa (of the South African National Defense Force of Pretoria, South Africa) have recently written about undue inducement in clinical research in developing countries. Their reflections and distinctions about the natures of undue inducement, coercion, exploitation, injustice, and deception are worth our attention. Saving “undue inducement” for last, let us briefly examine this list of moral turpitudes per Emanuel’s analyses and ask if they apply to the dilemma contributor’s scenario. Were the participants “coerced” to participate in the final blood draw? One could make a strong argument that they weren’t. Coercion should be understood as a forced choice situation wherein whatever I choose, I will be worse off than I was before the decision situation presented itself. The classic coercive scenario is someone’s pointing a gun at you and threatening, “Your money or your life!” Either way you choose, you’re worse off. But in this scenario, the research participants could, and some did, refuse the second blood draw such that their situation did not change from how it was immediately before the research team knocked on their doors. To the extent that they could return to that baseline with a simple “No,” the home visit wouldn’t seem to qualify as coercion, especially if the team reiterated the villager’s right to refuse participation at the home visit. Nevertheless, it might be objected that the participants’ refusing would make some of them feel badly or guilty, especially given the history of their relationship with the research team. Perhaps the research team’s was exploiting a socioeconomic group such that they couldn’t say no. But exploitation doesn’t ring true either. Somewhat like coercion, exploitation also envisions the person being worse off for having accepted the offer or deal. However, although the exploited party receives some benefits from the deal, those benefits are considerably exceeded by the losses he or she sustains. A familiar example of exploitation would be to pay paltry wages to persons who are starving and desperate for work, such as occurs in sweatshops. The arrangement is an unjust one because it represents a lopsided distribution of benefits and burdens: Exploited parties customarily endure immense burdens in comparison to the meager benefits they receive. Indeed, whatever substantial benefits there are go to someone else. But the exploited parties are so desperate that they will do things they would ordinarily refuse under more humane, socioeconomically respectable arrangements. So, exploitation doesn’t appear to have happened here. The burdens or discomforts of a blood draw do not seem unreasonable compared with the benefits the participants received earlier by way of free medicine and health care. And people who receive attractive, desirable benefits as part of a deal are not thought to be exploited. But perhaps one might still object that the above doesn’t get at the situation under consideration, which concerns the way the research team might have overly pressured the subjects to participate in the final blood draw by visiting them at their homes. Note, however, that one can only do justice to that issue by examining the factors leading up to the home visit, as in: Were those antecedent factors so unduly influential that the participants simply could not refuse to give blood when the researchers knocked on their doors? Did the historical factors of the research team’s having provided benefits deplete the participants of their voluntariness to say “No”? Obviously, if the research team had just showed up at the participants’ homes with no antecedent history and asked for their research participation, the team would almost certainly have been denied. So it seems more accurate to ask whether the history of the participants’ and research team’s relationship that led up to the team’s physically appearing in the participant’s home amounted to “undue inducement.” Emanuel and his colleagues point out that undue inducement is always a matter of a benefits/burdens calculation, usually where the risk burden is high but the benefit is even higher. Because the benefit is so attractive, the inducement is thought “undue” because it compromises the judgment of the decider, who might be inclined to dismiss the gravity of the risk. One thinks of the film Indecent Proposal, where a married woman tells her husband that she has been offered a million dollars to sleep with a handsome, extremely wealthy man. She and her husband accept the offer, the deed is done, and they spend the rest of the movie managing its increasingly painful repercussions. But the present scenario does not seem to suggest an instance of undue inducement. The reason is that while it is hard to estimate the degree of benefit that accrued to the research participants—which in some instances, say, of an exceedingly ill child who was cured of his illness, could have been enormous—the actual degree of burden the participants experienced from their participation was modest. Importantly, the fact that certain participants might have reaped an immense benefit from their participation does not make the situation one of “undue” inducement because, as Emanuel points out, people are induced to do things all the time. To eradicate inducements or incentives from life would make many relationships very different from the way we have become accustomed. Relationships become ethically problematic not only when the inducement is large, but when it tempts the individual to do something excessively or unreasonably risky or unpleasant. In the extant case, that level of risk or burden appears not to have been present. Perhaps some readers will still want to argue that the researchers’ appearance at the participants houses was “coercive” by interpreting the situation this way: When the research team appeared at a home—and again we are assuming that the team members asked for the participants’ permission to proceed with the blood draw—the dweller was faced with two choices: The first was to refuse participation and perhaps feel very guilty; the second was to participate and feel the unpleasantness of the needle stick. Either way, the participant is worse off than he or she was before the research team’s knock on the door. Thus the situation was coercive. Nevertheless, if the entirety of the research relationship with the participants is taken into account, especially regarding the benefits the latter received earlier by way of free medicines and health care, it is hard to indict the house call of the research team as coercive. Neither guilt induction from refusing to participate nor the prick of the needle drawing blood seems excessively nasty, while the free medicines and treatment accruing to the participants from their first blood draw seems to considerably offset, if not negate altogether, the discomfort of a second stick. One does not come away from a truly coercive offer with a striking, net benefit. In sum, while the blood draw taken at the participants’ homes might have deviated from the research protocol (and therefore must be reported as such), it does not appear to be morally tainted. Protecting the welfare of research participants appeared to have been preserved and, assuming the participants were reminded of their right to decline the second draw, respect for their right of informed consent was reasonably preserved. We should add a postscript, however, not contemplated in the scenario. Methodologists might well question whether the data is compromised by the first set of blood draws occurring in a clinical setting, while the second occurred in the participants’ homes. This was certainly a protocol deviation that merits a legitimate worry. Perhaps the best way to handle it is for the authors to disclose it in the methods section of their report or manuscript.

39,"A patient is handed a consent form to allow their tissue samples to be used for current and future research. However, before signing the final page, the patient has one request: they would like to edit the form before finalizing their agreement to participate. The patient does not want to give up ownership of their tissue, but still very much wants to participate. The patient would like to write, “I retain ownership of all tissue” on the hard copy form of consent and then sign it. Confused about the legality and permissibility of the patient editing the consent form, the research coordinator requests a research ethics consult.","While patients do have the right to decide whether or not to participate in research and whether to donate bodily tissue for research, the right to ownership and control over the use of that tissue no longer exists once it leaves the patient’s body. This standard has been set by a number of court cases. Moore v. Regents of California (1990) confirmed that while proper informed consent is necessary for research, a person’s donated tissue and cells are not considered to be their property. A more recent case, Greenberg v. Miami (2003), further solidified the ruling of Moore v. California. A young patient with Canavan, a rare genetic disease, donated extensive samples that aided research that ultimately resulted in the development of a prenatal test to screen for the disease. If patients retained ownership and control of their samples, the court argued, this would erroneously “give each donor complete control over how medical research is used and who benefits from that research.” Here, the emphasis should be placed on obtaining proper informed consent that makes patients aware of their participation in and contribution to research. Moreover, patients should be made cognizant of the fact that they do not own tissue that is taken either for clinical or research purposes. In addition, they must be aware that they will not financially profit from potential products produced by the research. The AMA Code of Medical Ethics mandates that the financial interests and potential commercial profit must be disclosed to the patient prior to their agreement to participate. When supplied with this knowledge and engaged in a thorough discussion aimed to identify specific preferences and goals, a patient may arrive at a decision that is both more informed and concordant with their specific desires. If the inability to control how their tissue and information is used, and the fact that others may eventually profit from the advances made through the research with their tissue is not concordant with the patients’ views, the patient should not sign the tissue banking consent. In sum, the patient may not edit the consent to state that he or she retains ownership of the tissue. The patient should be reapproached and made aware that they do not own their tissue that has been extracted nor will they profit from research with it, but they can still donate it to research if they so choose. The choice is theirs.

","%Introduction:  
This dilemma centers on the conflict between a patient's desire to retain ownership of their tissue samples and the established legal precedent that once tissue is donated for research, ownership is relinquished. The situation raises important questions about informed consent and patient autonomy in research participation.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the legal status of tissue ownership post-donation, the ethical obligation to provide informed consent, and the patient's right to understand the implications of their participation in research. The balance between patient autonomy and the realities of research practices is also crucial.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
The research coordinator should engage the patient in a thorough discussion about the implications of tissue donation, emphasizing that ownership is not retained. Providing clear information about the lack of financial profit from research outcomes and ensuring the patient understands their rights can help facilitate informed consent. If the patient remains uncomfortable, they should be encouraged to reconsider their participation.

%Key Takeaways:  
Patients cannot edit consent forms to assert ownership over donated tissue, as legal precedents dictate that ownership is relinquished upon donation.

40,"A few years ago during my post-Doc, I had an advisor who seemed just plain nuts. Psychiatrists might label him “narcissistic,” “paranoid,” “compulsive,” “anti-social,” “emotionally disregulated,” but I think he was crazy. He’d lash out at students; pound his desk in anger; and threaten to refuse to pay work-study students. While I was working on my project, he’d call me sometimes late at night—twice around midnight—with suggestions. He’d drag on some students’ theses interminably. Nevertheless, I don’t think he ever really “damaged” anyone significantly; he was just very peculiar and unpredictable. And many people found it impossible to work for him. After weighing the pro’s and con’s of leaving the group, I decided to stick it out unlike several other students who came with a smile but left aghast at what they experienced. However, some students did not leave without first filing formal complaints about my advisor’s behavior with the Dean. Twice, I was asked to testify to the concerns of these students. Knowing that my advisor would destroy me if I said anything negative about him, I hedged and was vague on the really probing questions. After completing my post-Doc, I was asked again to write an evaluation of this nutty professor, and I was kind. The dilemma is that if I said anything bad about him, I would be kissing a good recommendation good-bye. However, if I didn’t say anything negative, my advisor’s nuttiness would probably continue. So, my self-interest won out. Now, I always have a good recommendation letter whenever needed. And if I had to do it all over again, I’d do the same thing. In fact, I understand this professor’s behavior has improved, probably as a result of the investigation. So, all’s well that ends well. Had I formally complained, it would have cost me more than I could afford. As I said, if I had to do it all over again, I’d do the same thing.","We believe there are two overriding ethical issues in this case. Most important is that students who speak up about the PI must be protected. The second is that, if necessary, the PI’s behavior must be institutionally addressed with efforts at remediation if deemed necessary. But before one pulls out some heavy-duty interventions such as launching an investigation from the Dean’s or Chair’s office, some preliminary, “personnel management” considerations are in order. As it specifically affects the post-Doc, one would want to know precisely what the problem is with the PI. Is the problem over a grant? A paper? A project? Or chronic unprofessional behavior. We ask this because our experience has been that PIs such as this professor are usually not out to harm anyone explicitly. Rather the harm they wreak is psychological: They usually don’t realize how their problematic behavior affects others, e.g., by terrifying them, causing poor morale, etc. Oftentimes, theirs is a kind of abuse that often stays below a University’s radar screen, as people tend to write if off as unpleasant but tolerable. If personnel left this PI’s in droves, however, it is hard to imagine why any University would keep him on, because the financial and institutional liabilities of a public scandal are usually not worth whatever productivity such people generate. Rather the PI’s neurotic behaviors or odd personality is usually what others find bewildering and upsetting, perhaps because so many students or supervisees have had little experience in relating to such a person. On that note, we cannot resist some armchair psychologizing: Our experience with such individuals as the PI has been that they are not malevolent, but often have a core personality that admits a good deal of anxiety and compulsiveness. (Anxiety and especially compulsiveness are often thought to be professionally “adaptive” traits, especially among bright people, since they dispose those persons to be extremely attentive to detail, persevering, focused, and results-oriented. It is not at all surprising that very successful individuals often manifest these traits in high degree.) What investigators at elite institutions are often most anxious about is the quality of science that their lab personnel are doing. The reason, of course, is that if the science is poor, the grant will not be funded, tenures will not be granted, reputations will tank, the lab might dissolve, etc. Once such persons as this PI become suspicious that the science is not up to par— and it doesn’t take them long to reach that conclusion—their poorly regulated emotional architecture gets the best of them, and they can act badly. An approach that we therefore recommend is that the lab personnel and especially the post-Doc learn how to “control” the PI. Now, because lack of communication so often heightens the anxiety of such persons as the PI, the postDoc (and others) should try to 1) discern as much and with as much precision as possible what the PI is expecting from him or her by way of the grant, paper, project, etc., and 2) maintain an extremely regular and constant stream of communication with the PI on the progress pertaining to exactly those interests and concerns. The psychological Albert Bernstein has written about how compulsive personalities (and all compulsives are driven by fear and anxiety) like nothing better than to be working and surrounded by similarly, hard working people: [W]ork is their pride, their joy, their obsession, their drug, the alpha and omega of their existence. It is their gift, and the cross they have to bear. When Obsessive-Compulsives are working, they feel good about themselves and safe. If you want to feel safe, you’d better be working too. Consequently, one of the best ways to “manage” such people is by a steady stream of contact whose content is incisive, anticipatory of problems, and pertinent to the desired outcome. To the extent that our postDoc—as well as the other people in the lab—can impress the PI with their own compulsiveness, their relationship will probably go as smoothly as it can. Moreover, the postDoc will learn a valuable lesson: that now, he or she is assuming something of a “managerial” function—i.e., from a graduate student who largely took and executed orders to a post-Doc who now must learn to “drive” people and projects. But if that approach fails, we can go to Plan B but recall our primary ethical objective of protecting the personnel involved. This might very well entail re-locating some of the PI’s students or post-Docs to another lab. The Chair might very well want to appoint a committee whose members will conduct numerous conversations and inquiries among lab personnel, so that some kind of reliable picture of the PI’s behaviors appears. For example, is there a pattern to the PI’s behavior, or is it more a one-time event related to some discrete situation? The investigation would probably be conducted by the PI’s Chair who will ultimately decide on what kind of response is needed from the PI, e.g., apologies to personnel, a treatment program for unprofessional behavior, or dismissal from the University. The committee members must act especially in good faith, meaning that they will not allow whatever concerns they might have about the PI retaliating against them to overwhelm their duty to deal justly with the situation and insure that the PI’s future students will be treated professionally and respectfully. Obviously, the committee will want to develop a large paper trail that corroborates their findings and recommendations, as it might very well be the case that the PI will want to vigorously defend himself against the charges. The post-Doc is especially vulnerable in all this and should be assigned to a group of mentors who can keep his career on track. These kinds of situations are not uncommon. Every research university will have its share of peculiar personalities. Perhaps the most challenging problem for leadership is to proceed with courage through the various stages of an investigation, and especially to recognize that faculty simply do not have the right to demean or disrespect their students or supervisees. Students should be informed that such is the case and that when, in their best judgment, faculty are acting inappropriately, they can avail themselves of help without fear of retaliation or penalty. Oftentimes, faculty like the PI do not appreciate the impact of their problematic behaviors on others, and if they continue such behaviors, it is almost always because their institutions allow them to. After all, the reason the dilemma contributor feels somewhat confident that his “keeping silent” strategy worked is because—not surprisingly—he was decidedly convinced that it was his safest option. And he obviously formed that impression by observing the mores of the various institutions with which he was familiar. That is unfortunate. Personnel who are at the lower end of an oranization’s pyramid of power or authority are owed better.

","%Introduction:  
This dilemma highlights the ethical complexities surrounding the behavior of a problematic advisor in an academic setting, where the fear of retaliation can lead to silence about unprofessional conduct. The situation raises questions about the responsibilities of students to speak out against inappropriate behavior and the institutional mechanisms in place to protect them.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the psychological impact of the advisor's behavior on students, the potential for retaliation against those who speak out, and the need for institutional accountability. The balance between self-preservation and ethical responsibility is also crucial, as is the recognition of the advisor's underlying issues that may contribute to their behavior.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
The case reflects broader themes in academic ethics, particularly the need for protective measures for students. Historical precedents show that problematic faculty behavior often goes unchecked due to institutional inertia, leading to a culture where students feel compelled to prioritize their own career prospects over ethical considerations. Theories of power dynamics in academic settings further illuminate the challenges faced by students in addressing such issues.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
Recommended strategies include establishing clear channels for reporting unprofessional behavior without fear of retaliation, such as anonymous reporting systems or dedicated ombudspersons.

41,"Dr. Stupendous was world-renowned—a fact that he reminded himself and his staff of every day. One reason that he was world-renowned is because his post-docs worked like maniacs and turned out an endless stream of manuscripts and grants. Dr. Stupendous was quite a motivator, which brings up the ethical problem I observed. Every year, Stupendous hired at least 3 post-docs and frankly told them at their hiring that they would all be assigned to the same project. Whoever was first to produce a manuscript that, in his opinion, was ready for publication would be asked to stay. The others would be asked to leave at the end of their commitment. The latters’ letters of recommendation would be based upon the amount of progress they made in the time they had remaining in the lab. While I suppose competition is a healthy thing, Stupendous’s version of it struck me as both sadistic and somewhat lunatic. It’s hard to imagine a laboratory marked by collegiality and trust, given Stupendous’s ground rules. But, alternatively, science is keenly competitive and his strategy certainly seemed to make for a work ethic whose productivity was the envy of every lab at the University. Still, I don’t think I’d want to do a post-doc with this guy. Is this the way hiring and productivity rules for post-docs should be laid down?","This scenario raises a number of questions about the kind of professional environment the leadership of a laboratory should want to realize. For example, one would think it uncontroversial that the laboratory’s leadership would want the work environment to be as intellectually stimulating and as personally satisfying as possible. One would also want the lab environment to encourage good science so that collegial resources would always be available to provide insight and recommendations to investigators in their framing hypotheses, designing experiments carefully, executing them faithfully, and insuring the integrity of their data. Also, one would want a lab to maintain an ethical atmosphere whereby personnel demonstrate traits or sensibilities that are protective of the welfare of human participants, that treat laboratory animals as humanely as possible, that assure data integrity, and that protect the reputation of the institution. So, with this as our background, let us consider Professor Stupendous’s motivational strategy for new post-docs. Now, it is tempting but perhaps misguided to frame this assessment along the lines of “What is likely to happen in Stupendous’s lab given the atmosphere that is induced by the competitive nature of his strategy?” The reason why is that there are too many imponderables at play, and we’d be overspeculating in a way that would invite too many hunches and biases. (And, of course, we have no crystal ball.) A more ethically credible approach might instead ask: Is there anything that might be morally worrisome, given Stupendous’s approach to evaluating and supporting the performance of new post-docs? In other words, assuming the truth of the above observations about the value of maintaining an intellectually stimulating and professionally satisfying lab, the value of collegiality in producing high-quality science, and the importance of instilling professional virtues, is there room for legitimate worry or concern that Stupendous’s strategy will seriously fail to realize these aspirations? It seems beyond debate that Stupdendous’s strategy will force his new post-docs to think very strategically and to understand their relationship with one another as decidedly competitive—after all, to only one will go the spoils. One worry, then, is that a post-doc might not pursue a project that particularly interests her or that she particularly values, but rather one that she believes will get her first across the finish line. This would be lamentable, of course, because although investigators are always faced with constraints, e.g., available funding, available technology, available knowledge, etc., the academe generally sponsors creativity and career growth. But if Bill were one of Stupendous’s post-docs and was faced with choosing between a project that 1) really fascinates him, 2) would have a huge scientific payoff, but 3) is very novel, 4) challenging to pull off and 5) would require lots of time with no payoff in any way guaranteed, he might very well opt for a much safer project, even if it’s relatively uninteresting and of only modest scientific value. In short, we worry that the first two years of each of these post-docs’ stays in Stupendous’s lab will be spent on their concentrating on projects that will enable them to survive, rather than work on producing exemplary, exciting science. There is another worry about how cognitive or judgmental biases might creep in and compromise scientific objectivity, given the pressure the post-docs are under. For example, the “availability” or “confirmatory” biases are both well recognized, where the investigator or scholar—who in such cases does not have the leisure to be as rigorously objective as he should be—either seizes upon the first explanation that is available to explain his results, or only accepts evidence that confirms his favored theory of what is happening. He does this because of what the military have called “target fixation.” His desire to attain his goal is so intense that it has blinded him to other variables that need to be considered. Inattention to them might result in carelessness, intellectual hubris, and then horror when his project goes down in flames. We might also worry about how these post-docs, all working on the same project, will come to understand and configure their relationships with one another. Surely, they are in a stressful, competitive situation. Probably too, they are very bright and ambitious. At the very least, one might speculate that these post-docs will not share their data with one another since that would be tantamount to giving ammunition to the enemy. (Indeed, one wonders how Stupendous has choreographed their lab partner affiliations: Given the fact that the post-docs are competing against one another by working on a similar project, does each post-doc work with a different team such that none of the teams talk to one another? If so, such a sensibility or lab practice would contradict the practice of data sharing, which is widely valued and anticipated in research labs.) At worst, of course, anyone ought to be worried that given the pressure Stupendous’s post-docs are under, sooner or later one of them will be sorely tempted to sabotage the others’ projects. Sadly, there are too many stories about researchers contaminating one another’s samples, changing labels on specimens, or stealing or destroying one another’s data. How does Stupendous police for this? In some of our other opinions, we have mentioned Shamoo and Resnik’s list of scientific virtues. We are especially worried that the virtues of objectivity, integrity, openness, and respect for colleagues are imperiled by Dr. Stupendous’s work strategy for new post-docs. One hopes that there are professionally healthier ways to accomplish the professional objectives that Dr. Stupendous values and that do not threaten the erosion of scientific virtues as his approach does.

42,"I did my undergraduate work in a biological research lab that was proud to host numerous high school students throughout the year. Each student would learn basic microbiological techniques by isolating and characterizing novel viruses from the environment. Many would use this experience for a high school graduation project. One time during the Spring semester, the coordinator of this program received an e-mail from a local high school student who stated he was working with us for his senior high school science project. He inquired in the e-mail if he could ask the coordinator some questions about the program. The coordinator responded affirmatively, so the student followed up with a list of questions. Upon reading the questions, however, the coordinator was struck by the fact that they were not the type of questions that a student who participated in the program would ask, e.g., “What does your program do?” “What building is your program located in?” So, the coordinator became suspicious as to whether the student actually set foot in the lab to do the work he claimed he was doing. So we investigated. We searched for notebooks with his name on it, his name in the time logs, and his initials on community reagents. We went back through old emails to see if he had been assigned a mentor to work with us. Our efforts turned up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence that this student had performed the work he claimed to have done. After a brief discussion on whether we should notify the student’s teacher, we did. In fact, we contacted both the teacher and the principal. We explained that we had no evidence that this student had ever worked with us, and if he claimed to have done so for a high school project, he was lying. As it turned out, the student had indeed claimed to have worked with our lab, and he fabricated the data on his project as well. The high school required him to redo the project, which meant he couldn’t graduate that Spring. It seems to me our decision to contact the high school was entirely proper. Do you agree?","Absolutely. The lab had an overriding professional obligation to contact the high school and discuss this occurrence. Many, if not all professional organizations impose a moral obligation on their members to call attention to wrongdoing. In this case, the initial communication between the student and the program coordinator was not the privileged sort that occurs between a lawyer and a client, or a priest and a penitent. Indeed, the lab’s failure to do so would arguably have taught a youngster that he could get away with a remarkable act of deception. With college applications becoming more competitive, scenarios like this one might be becoming more familiar. Students have been known to ""join"" teams and groups and ""volunteer"" for community projects which they can list on their applications when, in reality, they participate very little in these endeavors. Parents also are in collusion with many of these endeavors as they arrange ""internships"" at their companies or other places where they have standing. Teenagers and young adults may be our least capable and experienced moral agents, while our educational system (both secondary and higher education) often generates situations with a lot of temptation, little chance of getting caught, and not much information about or support for making good ethical decisions. One approach might be to encourage secondary education and higher education to work both separately and collaboratively to ensure that students develop, nurture, encourage, and support good ethical decision making. For example, high schools might want to select textbooks that incorporate explicit instruction in ethics or develop those units themselves. Colleges might want to think about replacing admissions policies that encourage students to list as many activities as possible and, instead, ask for one letter from a person who has supervised an outside activity in which the student was genuinely involved. One hopes the student learned his lesson. One wonders, however, whether the high school’s disciplinary action appeared on the student’s academic record. If the student applies to college, the displeasure of his having to explain his wrongdoing, as so documented, might drive home the gravity of his behavior in a way that just making up the science project over the summer wouldn’t.","%Introduction:

43,"Some years ago, a graduate student obtained some funding from an external, private source that would support his stipend, enable him to travel, and, very importantly, allow him to purchase supplies (e.g., cells and reagents) for his research. This funding came as a considerable relief because the University had recently had to assume significant budget cuts in research programs, and the student anticipated needing some expensive materials for his research. As the student tried to move his project forward, however, he was stymied by the PI (who was also the lab director) who refused the student’s requests for supplies and reagents. The PI explained that “the funds are no longer there,” and that the student should cease making inquiries regarding the nature and amount of his grant monies. The student finally approached the Dean of Research and explained his concerns. The Dean’s response was much in line with the PI’s: That the University has had to cut budgets, that the PI has the authority over expenditures, that everyone must make do in these hard times, and that the student should simply accept these limitations and be grateful he still has his entire stipend. The Dean also noted that the PI is one of the University’s most valued faculty members and that any public accusations against him would be intolerable. The student tried one more strategy: He requested and received a full audit of his grant from the lab’s financial administrator. As the student reviewed an itemized list of purchases charged to the grant, he noted multiple travel expenses, costs for reagents and cells, and some other items that were never used in his project. The student returned to the Dean’s office with these findings. The Dean became very upset and said, “You had no right to request this. It is very clear to me that you are not the kind of team player we expect our students to be here. By doing this, you should know you have jeopardized your career here and anywhere else for that matter.” Traumatized by the exchange, the student wondered what to do next.","It is disturbing but hardly beyond reason to think that such a case might occur today. One can at least imagine an ethically obtuse PI thinking: “This is my lab. I’m in control. All the money that comes into it is within my discretion to allocate. This kid’s a graduate student with a grant, but I have two postdocs who’ve been here forever and need jobs. Obviously, their need is greater, so it seems perfectly ethical of me to take from Peter to give to Paul. As for the graduate student complaining that I’m not approving his purchase requests, I’ll simply say that his work isn’t far enough along to merit them, which is why I deny them. And regarding the audit, I’ll just say that it was an honest mistake, or that I was going to reimburse the student’s account anyway; that I did it for the sake of expediency and that I had no intention whatsoever of defrauding anybody’s grant. And if that graduate student thinks things were unpleasant up until now, he has no idea what’s in store.” We shall simply state what anyone reading this scenario should already know: When an institution accepts a grant, the institution is obligated to comply with the terms of the award. While some grants may provide considerable leeway for a research team to spend whatever money is allocated however the team wants, it is extremely likely that the graduate student’s award was precisely targeted to his research and its associated expenses. If so, his grantor would obviously have a straightforward right to anticipate that the moneys would be spent for those stipulated purposes and not for others. Put simply, the relationship between the grantor and the grantee is a contractual one: The grantor issues a request for proposals and presumably promises to award monies to the one(s) that the grantor selects. In return for receipt of those monies, the awardees agree to abide by the promises and stipulations they made in their original proposals. Given the above scenario, then, the PI obviously committed fraud by using funds stipulated for one purpose to reimburse totally unrelated ones. One can only imagine the reaction from the student’s granting agency if it learned of this! Astonishingly, the Dean of Research seems oblivious to this basic understanding and supports the PI’s fraudulent behavior. This is why the best strategy for handling a situation like this might well be for universities to have a “hot-line” to which complaints can be made and investigated. While some complaints will be nonmeritorious, others—presumably like the graduate student’s—will certainly be of interest to the institution. Technically, of course, the student’s University is the recipient of the grant, which is sub-contracted to the PI’s lab where the student works. Consequently, it is the University that is expected to maintain the integrity of its relationships with its grantors. While the moral motivation of the University’s interest in this case involves its promissory obligations pursuant to receiving grant dollars, the practical reason for a University’s pursuing complaints like the student’s is simple: The PI’s fraudulent behavior can endanger the entire University’s ability to secure extramural funding. A university must be able to police this kind of bad behavior so as to make a good faith showing to the research community of its integrity and fiscal responsibility. Even a relatively small instance of fraud, like this one, can do incalculable damage to an institution’s reputation and its funding streams. What generally happens with a “hot-line” complaint at research universities is that the complaint goes directly to a regulatory compliance officer. After an initial review, he or she will appoint an individual who has administrative oversight of the problematic department or division and who will conduct the investigation. Importantly, the investigation is a formal and anonymous one, meaning that once the graduate student submits his complaint, the investigation proceeds independently of him or her. Relevant findings will be turned over to the University’s appropriate oversight committee. We will not discuss determining the severity of penalty imposed on guilty parties, except to say that no case of overt fraud seems insignificant. Indeed, to treat any as such would give the perpetrators permission to continue their nefarious ways. Universities that are serious about fiscal integrity will likely have low “between-group interdependencies.” In other words and as in this case, financial functions like auditing will be separate and organizationally insulated from the ongoing, day to day work of the employees they monitor. That insulation is extremely important in policing behaviors like fraud for the simple reason that high between-group interdependencies make it all the easier for unethical complicities to occur. This observation is borne out in studies of organizational corruption, which show that the extent of corrupt behaviors is often a function of how closely knit the involved groups are, especially if they collectively share rewards or punishments. Thus, if the PI or Dean of Research could reasonably threaten the University’s auditors with harm if they brought forth incriminating evidence against the PI, then finance’s oversight function would be disabled. And that brings us to our final point, which is that rather than threaten the complaining student, the Dean should protect him, take his concerns seriously, and follow up. The Dean must appreciate how the student’s accusation of the PI will affect the student’s career: If an investigation clears the PI of wrongdoing, the student’s accusation will be deemed malicious and the student will be branded as dangerous. If an investigation finds the PI guilty of fraud, the student will still be in the middle of a very unpleasant situation. Either way, the student’s accusing the PI of fraud will end their relationship—which is something that a thoughtful, compassionate Dean should appreciate. But this Dean seems nothing of the sort. One can only think that the Dean and this PI have witnessed a long relationship during which they enjoyed virtually unchecked power to spend money however they wanted. They probably could not have enjoyed that history without additional complicity from other executives in the University, who surely knew of the goings on. While the Dean and the PI may believe they are invulnerable to investigation or penalty, numerous and recent examples show how wrong they might be. Obviously, their behaviors and ideologies are remarkably contrary to the most fundamental of moral expectations, and they need to be held accountable for their actions.

44,"Probably the most common dilemma a TA experiences, other than grading exams and papers objectively and fairly, occurs when he or she suspects instances of cheating. Unfortunately, I had two such experiences during my days in graduate school under two different instructors. The first time it happened, I went to the course instructor and told her about my suspicions. The issue involved two students who obviously worked together on their lab reports although the instructions—which were explicit and exceptionless—forbade collaboration. When I showed the instructor the students’ papers, she frowned and said, “I’ll handle it.” The second time it happened—and, remarkably, the same kind of cheating: collaborating on a study when the students were instructed to work independently—the instructor told me to take care of it. This latter instance of cheating was even more blatant than the first, and I made up my mind to take it to the honor council. But when I told the instructor of my decision, he suggested I not go that route. He said that in his experience, these things are better handled privately, i.e., just between the students and the faculty. That’s what the first instructor did, incidentally, and I wound up doing the same thing: Having the students redo the assignment but turning in a lower, final grade for their deviating from instructions. I was never satisfied with these approaches. Cheating is cheating and should, in my opinion, be formally addressed. If students only get a slap on the wrist, they learn that cheating is not as bad as it’s made out to be. And if they decide to have a career in science, a favorable attitude towards cheating is exactly what we don’t want them to develop. What are your thoughts?","The TA was certainly correct to go to his or her instructors given these situations, but we are inclined to agree with the TA that each instance was handled suboptimally. Perhaps one can understand an instructor’s reluctance to report these incidents directly to the honor council or whatever entity is explicitly charged by the University to investigate instances of cheating. The instructor might fear his or her becoming involved in a time-consuming investigation punctuated by numerous, emotionally uncomfortable encounters. However, we suggest that when there is enough evidence to believe that cheating has occurred, the professor should report the incident to whatever committee or council is tasked with conducting such investigations. The professors’ fears that such investigations would require too much of his or her time and prove unreasonably distressing are probably exaggerated. At least in our experience, what generally happens is that the case is removed from the instructor’s purview altogether. Of course, the faculty member should make copies of any relevant documents before turning them over to the investigators and make notes about any conversations with anyone (such as the TA) that are pertinent to the incident. But turning the investigation over to an Honor Council or the like relieves both the professor and the TA from having to determine that cheating actually occurred and, thus, somewhat distances them from whatever emotional distress will result. Usually, the subsequent investigation is entirely conducted by the oversight committee with the professor and the TA being available for informing the committee of their experiences, just as the accused students will be able to do. Furthermore, a penalty will be determined (or possibly mandated) by the committee. By virtue of the committee’s primarily handling the investigation itself, the accused students will tend to focus their dismay towards it rather than towards the professor or the TA. (Presumably, the instructor will desist from giving the students a grade until the investigation is complete.) One also hopes that the institution would have an office where incidents like this are reported and recorded. This would deter “serial cheating,” wherein certain students might cheat numerous times in numerous courses. Without a central repository that is aware of previous cheating, students could get away with a series of relatively minor sanctions by faculty members without ever suffering a serious penalty like suspension or expulsion. We are impressed with the TA’s worry that a tepid response to instances of cheating undercuts the goal of instilling scholarly integrity among the student body. Cheating is a serious offense and its associated suspicions need to be dealt with aggressively.","%Introduction:  
The dilemma highlights the challenges faced by teaching assistants (TAs) when they suspect academic dishonesty among students. The TA's experiences reveal a tension between the desire for integrity in academic work and the reluctance of instructors to escalate cheating incidents to formal investigations.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the severity of cheating, the responsibility of instructors to uphold academic integrity, the emotional burden on TAs and faculty, and the potential long-term implications of lenient responses to cheating on students' ethical development.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, academic institutions have grappled with the issue of cheating and the appropriate responses. The reluctance to report incidents may stem from a fear of administrative processes, but this can lead to a culture where cheating is tolerated. The concept of scholarly integrity is foundational to academic success and professional ethics, particularly in fields like science.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
A recommended approach is for instructors to report cheating incidents to the appropriate honor council or committee, which can conduct a thorough investigation.

45,"Professor Merlin has never gotten along well with his postdoc, Dr. Lancelot. The reasons seem elusive. Lancelot was a very independent researcher from the start, who never seemed to want Merlin’s mentoring or advice. Merlin, on the other hand, was not a particularly warm or congenial fellow and only helped his postdocs if they asked him. Nevertheless, Lancelot was no slouch, having published 2, first-author papers (with another two in the hopper) while working in Merlin’s lab. Unfortunately, their relationship has become even more distant over the last 4 months, as Lancelot is finishing his postdoc and is applying for academic positions at other research institutions. Lancelot has decided not to ask Merlin for a letter of recommendation because he feels certain that Merlin’s letter would be less than glowing. Merlin learns about one of Lancelot’s job applications and knows the individual who is supervising the search. Merlin is upset that Lancelot neither informed him of his application nor asked for a letter of recommendation. He sends the search supervisor an unsolicited email in which he (Merlin) offers a rather negative opinion of Lancelot. The search supervisor knows both Merlin and Lancelot personally and has come to admire Lancelot’s work. He contacts Lancelot and, while not sharing the details of Merlin’s email, tells him about Merlin’s unsolicited “nonrecommendation.” Lancelot is stupefied and enraged by this revelation and considers legal action against Merlin. Does Merlin have a right to offer his opinion in the manner he did? Was he prudent in doing so? What should Lancelot be advised on proceeding?","Although this scenario has obvious legal dimensions, the reader needs to know that nothing in what follows should be understood as legal advice or recommendations. None of the consultants whose thoughts appear below are in a position to offer such counsel, but even if they were, jurisdictions differ dramatically on what causes of action and defenses might be available to parties in a case like this or how evidence might be interpreted. Also, we don’t know enough details, especially per the contents of Merlin’s letter of nonrecommendation, to make legally informed comments. Therefore, readers who desire a legal opinion on a scenario like this one are advised to seek such from a licensed attorney. With that said, this case resembles so many of the others on this website: That with some sensitive as well as aggressive communication early on by Merlin and Lancelot, this very unpleasant situation could easily have been averted. Hindsight is always 20/20, but as so many mentoring dilemmas demonstrate, core problems often do not reside in the quality of an individual’s work but rather in the psychodynamics of the mentor-mentee relationship. This seems to have occurred in the above. Lancelot is apparently doing excellent and productive work, yet his professional relationship with Merlin is deteriorating for reasons that are unknown. We believe that no matter how independently-spirited Lancelot might be, his choosing to manage that deteriorating relationship by distancing himself and his work from his mentor is ill advised. What Lancelot should have done from the start—and what, we believe, every postdoc should appreciate and practice—is to maintain a reasonable degree of communication with the mentor that updates him or her on any issues that reasonably affect their professional relationship and its goals. We have recommended elsewhere—see, for instance, the case “The Nutty Professor,”—that postdocs should take the lead in sculpting the mentor-mentee relationship. They should meet with their mentors regularly and discuss their experiments and progress. Postdocs simply cannot dismiss the importance of maintaining their mentors’ good will and advocacy. On the other hand, Merlin seems to have dramatically failed in his mentorship role. As a mentor, Merlin should at least provide periodic supervision, constructive criticism, and support to his mentees. If their work is inadequate, he must inform them of that, explain why, and assist them to improve whatever deficiencies they have. Consequently, Merlin’s mentoring-ata-distance-and-only-if-you-ask-me philosophy seems the antithesis of good mentoring, and certainly contributed to the situation above. Given what occurred, Lancelot should speak personally with Merlin about the latter’s communication. While the conversation would doubtlessly be a difficult one, Lancelot should come clean with his feelings about Merlin, explain his discomfort about asking Merlin for a letter of recommendation, and allow Merlin to explain what prompted his nonrecommendation. Lancelot should listen nonjudgmentally to Merlin’s explanation—which might be very difficult—and then attempt to negotiate some kind of plan whereby their inevitable parting can occur in a professional, amicable fashion. Lancelot needs to appreciate the importance of Merlin’s support, while Merlin needs to appreciate the injudiciousness of his rash action and the unpleasantries it might invite. Of course, Merlin seems to have done did a remarkably injudicious thing in writing an unsolicited correspondence to the search supervisor. Lancelot might interpret the letter as “defamatory” because Merlin’s unsolicited nonrecommendation might not only cost Lancelot a job but blemish him in the eyes of the scientific community if word of Merlin’s communication spreads. (A familiar characterization of defamation is “if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.”) Lawsuits notwithstanding, though, how prudent was Lancelot in deciding to forego asking Merlin for a letter of recommendation? How credible is a postdoc on the job market who does not present a prospective employer with a recommendation from his mentor, principal investigator, or lab director? Our understanding is that virtually no future employer of a postdoc ever hires him or her, especially for a faculty position, without contacting the postdoc’s mentor. Even though Merlin found out about Lancelot’s job application accidentally, he would doubtlessly have received some kind of inquiry from the potential employer anyway (especially as they were professionally acquainted). How could Lancelot have not known, considered, and appreciated this? Postdocs are usually told early in their careers and throughout their training about the importance of maintaining a civil relationship with mentors and how the telephone call for their next job is virtually inevitable. But Lancelot seemed oblivious to all this. And one last thing: Lancelot needs very much to consider what implications his pursuing legal action against his mentor can have in the academic/scientific community. Even if he prevails in a legal action, one would think the undertaking would have a “chilling” effect on his job prospects because potential employers might forever balk at hiring someone who sued his mentor and perhaps his mentor’s institution.

46,"A doctoral student in a lab where I had previously worked was apparently doing well.
Bill had already published a first author manuscript in a high impact journal and had a
second under review. Unfortunately, however, Bill's laboratory colleagues were less
than professional, and he was frequently the butt of jokes and catty whispering. These
unprofessional behaviors were, in my view, typical of the lab as a whole but seemingly
condoned by Dr. Green, who did nothing to stop them.
One day, another graduate student in the lab, Larry, asked Bill for some bacterial
strains that Bill had developed and that Larry wanted to use for some follow-up work. In
Bill's haste, he accidentally handed the wrong strain to Larry, which Bill realized only
later on when it was too late to cancel the experiment.
The PI of this lab, Dr. Green, was known for maintaining a culture of fear,
recrimination and egoism among his lab personnel. I cannot help but think this played a
factor in what Bill did next: Upon realizing his error, he switched the labels on two vials
of bacterial strains, covering up his mistake in his lab notebooks and the lab stock
records.
When the lab results came back with data that didn't correlate with what Bill and
Larry knew from previous studies, Bill came clean and told Larry and Dr. Green about his
mistake and his subsequent cover-up. He told them that he had been agonizing about
his actions for weeks; he apologized profusely; and he offered to repeat the experiment
on Larry's behalf so as to make amends.
Dr. Green refused this course of action, however, and had Bill come before an
institutional ethics committee for a hearing and sanctioning. A number of persons
testified as character witnesses at the hearing—some for and some against Bill. As word
of what happened got around, the unpleasant interpersonal atmosphere in Dr. Green's
lab was discussed both informally and then formally at the hearing. What carried a
great deal of weight, however, was Dr. Green's own statement that, as things now
stood, he could not trust any of Bill's data and he claimed he could no longer support
Bill's doctoral work. Ultimately, the committee decided to grant Bill a masters degree
and he was asked to leave the program.
How does one ethically evaluate all these goings on? Clearly, Bill's cover-up
behaviors were deplorable, but did the eventual punishment fit this crime? Would it
have been enough simply to accept Bill's apology and his offer to repeat the
experiments? Did Dr. Green over-react with vindictiveness and blame towards Bill,
especially as allegations about the poor psychological atmosphere of his laboratory
were aired about the department and in committee? What standards ought a
committee like this keep uppermost in their deciding the fate of someone like Bill and
in maintaining the professionalism of their university? ","The facts of the case suggest that Bill probably felt isolated as he was often disrespected and perhaps humiliated by other people in the lab. Also, it seems fair to say that Dr. Green is a poor leader, at least in the sense that he doesn’t protect his people from abuse and fails to maintain a work atmosphere of professionalism. In any event, Bill commits the error as described and then tries to cover it up. His deception seems motivated by a fear of retaliation or, perhaps, the expectation of additional ridicule should he immediately announce his mistake and not proceed with the cover-up. Two facts that very much tell against Bill, however, is that his deception is very careful and deliberate; second, he only speaks up when the experiments fail, and he feels the deception can no longer be maintained. Does this mean that if the experiment somehow succeeded or at least raised no suspicions, Bill would never have confessed? We believe that Dr. Green’s taking the matter to a formal committee is a very good idea. Such committees have experience with these kinds of situations; there is a good chance that the committee’s membership knows how the University’s policy on cheating or unprofessional behavior would apply to such a case as Bill’s; and one would like to think the committee will conduct a thorough investigation and offer an objective, reasonably just verdict. Notice that some lab directors might have chosen a much different course, however. For example, not wanting to make waves or call unwanted attention to his lab, a director might be tempted to bring Bill and Larry together in private and quietly work out some plan, perhaps along the lines that Bill originally suggested (e.g., he would repeat Larry’s experiment, etc.). But this approach cannot be preferred to the one actually taken because its real motivation is the self-interest of the lab director in keeping the incident quiet, not assuring that justice is done. Also, no one can guarantee that a deception like Bill’s can be entirely kept quiet. If it would get out, it is easy to anticipate additional problems, especially by way of acute embarrassment to University administration over the lab director’s failure to follow University policy. The title of this dilemma, however, is “Does the Punishment Fit the Crime?” There seem to be at least two approaches in providing an answer. The first is a strictly formal, nominalistic, rule-bound one that follows the University’s standards to the letter. Here justice is understood as the outcome of the University’s adjudicative process, regardless of what the ultimate sanction is. For example, some institutions like the University of Virginia maintain a “one strike and you’re out” policy. Students who willfully commit a moral turpitude such as Bill’s and are found out should therefore not be surprised when they are dismissed. Indeed, one might even argue that the University’s expelling Bill can be construed as something other than a punishment; that is, that it stands as an expression of the University’s opinion of Bill’s professional credibility: “Bill cannot be a scientist or continue to work at our University because he lacks the necessary professional attributes. In our opinion, he would be best advised to find another line of work.” A second approach would be a more contextualized or situational one where the committee might be sympathetic with the stress that Bill felt working in Dr. Green’s lab; that he momentarily “lost it” when he discovered his error; that overwhelming fear dictated his deciding to cover-up the error; that his eventual honesty should count for something; and that it would not be unreasonable to develop a “rehabilitative” plan for Bill. Thus, Bill might be ordered to participate in counseling; perhaps prepare a paper explaining the moral wrongness of his behavior and why deception should never occur in a laboratory. And Bill might be invited to find another lab to finish his doctorate. However, the fact that Dr. Green refuses to accept Bill back in his lab is very significant. Bill might find himself with no other lab that would accept him and be forced to leave the University. Ultimately, it seems difficult to fault the committee’s decision that Bill receive his master’s degree and leave the University. The University has a legitimate right to impose a sanction that is congruent with its historical tradition and which seems reasonably just (as this one does). Nevertheless, at least two ethical questions remain as Bill packs his bags. The first is, could there be a remedial plan for Bill (or people like him) such that one could be confident that Bill’s participating in the plan would reduce the likelihood of a repeat offense to virtually zero? If the most morally salient objective of any punishment is deterrence, how much trust would we be willing to place in a “rehabilitated” Bill? Can he ever be trusted again? And then there is Dr. Green’s poor leadership of the lab. If Green had insisted that personnel treat one another with professional respect, would this incident have ever happened? Indeed, did Green’s response to Bill constitute a deliberate overreaction to criticisms that the work atmosphere in his lab was unprofessional, such that Green decided to trumpet his moral integrity to the rest of the University by taking a hard and unyielding line on Bill? Should the University pursue some sort of remedial plan with Green that improves his personnel management skills? It’s interesting to speculate that readers of this dilemma might have dramatically different reactions to it because of the various imponderables included in the two paragraphs immediately above. As we leave the case, one thing seems to be morally certain, however: That any employee in any work setting has the right to be respected. A consistent failure among lab directors to promote such a work environment is a failure of organizational ethics and merits administrative scrutiny.

47,"Some years ago, I was a teaching assistant in an upper level, undergraduate, biology course. I presided over the last lab of the year, and when it came time to grade the lab reports, I came across two papers that were strikingly similar. When I put them side by side, I could see that not every word was the same, but each sentence of every paragraph of either paper was virtually identical in meaning to the other. While students were not disallowed from studying together, their lab papers were not a group project. So, these virtually identical papers looked like a clear violation of the rules, i.e., ""cheating."" I went to my faculty advisor who agreed with me that cheating doubtlessly occurred. What happened next surprised me. Without directly saying so but through rather vague phrases and overall demeanor, my advisor made it clear that carrying through on a disciplinary action would be extremely time consuming. She asked me what ""type"" of students these two were. I told her that they had done well all semester and that none of their other work appeared plagiarized. She gave me no explicit directive but advised me to ""take everything into account"" and then make my decision. There was no question in my mind that she would rather I take a softer approach to a disciplinary action. I then set up a meeting with the students. They did not admit to cheating but did say they worked together. After talking with them and thinking about my supervisor's ambivalent response, I decided not to carry through with the punishment. I gave each a slightly lower grade and the matter, with the full endorsement of my advisor, stopped there. My conscience has bothered me ever since. I'm not exactly sure why I took the easier course because I do believe my advisor would have backed me had I proceeded along the formal, disciplinary route. Or so I think. Nevertheless, instead of doing what I thought and felt was right and just, I caved in to my intuitions and maybe my fears. Am I wrong in placing some blame on my supervisor? I trusted that once her suspicions were confirmed, she would categorically endorse a disciplinary action against the students. But I was wrong. And to this day I regret that I went against my moral instincts and did something that was more convenient than just.","The failure of an instructor to respond appropriately to instances of suspected cheating or violations of an institution’s honor code is certainly ethically troublesome. In the present case, there is strong evidence that the students violated an explicit class directive, i.e., that each student was to compose his or her lab report independently from everyone else. In violating this rule, the students unfairly enhanced their advantage over other students by being able to exploit and use one another’s resources (e.g., notes, ideas, sources, etc.). The advantage that accrued to them was unfair to the rest of the class and so was a violation of justice. Also, by receiving a modest slap on the wrists by way of a slightly lower grade, the students might be motivated to cheat again, but to be more careful next time. Consequently, the failure to report this incident to, say, the institution’s honor council might reinforce these students’ tendency toward immoral behavior in the future—which bodes badly for whatever profession or career they enter. Also, the same “reinforcement” contingency applies to the teaching assistant. His or her failure to report this incident might heighten the probability of a similar, future failure where the teaching assistant—perhaps now a junior professor—just lowers the grade and walks away. (Indeed, there probably is some requirement at the teaching assistant’s institution that obligates faculty to report suspicions of cheating. Consequently, the teaching assistant’s failure to do so constitutes a moral infraction by way of a breach of his or her institutional obligations.) Last, the teaching assistant’s advisor cannot escape moral culpability since she gave positive but morally misguided cues to the teaching assistant to act in an excessively lenient fashion. Indeed, whereas the dilemma contributor places “some blame” on the advisor, we are inclined to think that the advisor perhaps bears the greatest moral onus because of her failure to role model—to a doubtlessly impressionable teaching assistant—a strong moral stand on reporting this cheating incident. Of course, cases like this one always present factors that tempt one to take what seems to be the “easier” course. For example, the teaching assistant might not have felt empowered enough to take the matter forward, especially once he or she formed the distinct impression from the advisor that doing so might not be wise. Or perhaps the teaching assistant wanted to disbelieve the idea that the students willfully cheated and was impressed during the interview with them that the students didn’t appear bent on malevolence or dishonesty, e.g., as tokened by their having been “good” students up to that point. Of course, there is nothing pleasant that issues from the kind of honor code investigation that the teaching assistant is contemplating. And that thought is, in and by itself, enough to considerably discourage its undertaking. Oddly, though, both the advisor and the teaching assistant committed a decisional error or misjudgment. At most institutions, the heavy lifting of such an investigation would not fall on either of them but rather on the honor council—or some reasonable facsimile—and its related personnel (e.g., deans, faculty advisors, etc.). In other words, after the teaching assistant decided that cheating probably occurred and secured the agreement of the advisor, the teaching assistant should have been encouraged to take the matter to the honor council, whereupon the matter would largely be removed from both the teaching assistant’s and the advisor’s authority. Once the matter goes to an honor council, what would likely occur is a preliminary investigation; then a decision on whether or not to refer the case for a hearing; and if yes, convening the hearing and handing down a decision, e.g., a grade of failure for the course that would be recorded on the students’ permanent transcript, or a period of suspension, or dismissal from the university, etc. While the students would probably have the support of an ombudsman and the availability of an appeal mechanism, the point is that the teaching assistant’s and advisor’s greatest fear, i.e., the onerous burden that reporting the cheating would impose on them, is probably highly exaggerated. Once the teaching assistant reports the incident, his or her involvement in the investigation would probably be limited to providing evidence in the preliminary investigation and at the hearing. And given the nature of this case, that evidential offering would probably not be terribly burdensome or time-consuming. By failing to go in that direction, however, the teaching assistant reports that “my conscience has bothered me ever since.” And that is understandable and, one would think, a good thing as we would not want the teaching assistant to be blasé about his or her moral lapse. Had the teaching assistant and advisor opted for reporting the incident to the honor council, there would have been moral closure on this incident. Yes, the investigation and probable hearing would have exposed the cheating students to a very unpleasant experience whose end result could conceivably have marred their career trajectories and aspirations. But much better that happen than 1) dismiss or ignore extant institutional rules whose moral justification is unimpeachable and inarguable, and 2) chance that these students will be inspired to practice more serious acts of plagiarism and moral turpitude in the future. Some readers of this opinion might argue that the investigation and hearing processes can invite much more harm to the teaching assistant and his or her advisor than is suggested here. For example, it is quite possible that the students’ parents will respond with a pronounced attack upon the teaching assistant, his or her advisor, and the university itself. That attack might involve threats of litigation and even physical harm. But no profession is risk free, and we do not make that statement lightly. If academic honor and integrity is to be a moral reality on university campuses rather than righteous sounding rhetoric, the test will come with cases like this one. Most importantly, institutions need to have strong, explicit, and uniform policies (i.e., adopted and implemented uniformly by all the schools or colleges within the university’s system) on managing such cases. And they obviously need to do as much as is reasonably possible to protect the professoriate from harmful repercussions and insure fairness to everyone involved.

48,"It isn’t terribly unusual for investigators to submit the same abstract for poster presentation to more than one conference. That way, the investigator, especially if he or she is a junior person, not only has a better chance of getting it accepted and enjoying the prestige of showing the poster in the exhibit hall, but also has an excuse for wangling some travel funds from his or her PI or lab director: “I can’t entirely afford to go to the conference, so I won’t be able to show this poster, which has been accepted and which has your name on it as a co-author incidentally. So, can you underwrite some of the costs?” The problem with this not unfamiliar practice of multiple submissions of the same abstract is that it virtually always violates the submission rules of conferences, which make authors promise that they have not submitted the material elsewhere (since the idea of poster presentation is that the material is novel and that conference attendees are learning it for the first time). But submitters know that because some of these conferences are so large, it is extremely unlikely that the same people will be refereeing posters for multiple conferences so that multiple submitters will be caught. Moreover, even if the same poster is accepted at two conferences, presenters can choose which one they want to go to and forego the other (so they remain in compliance with rules of never having or not planning to present the data elsewhere). Perhaps the most common strategy for making sure you don’t get caught is simply to vary the contents of each abstract submission a little. If both submissions are accepted, the author can plead that he believed they were essentially different from one another and that no violation of the program submission rules occurred. What is usually the case, though, is that the abstracts differ very modestly and are largely look-alikes. The practice is unfortunate, but the competition for presenting at the largest national conferences is keen. Submitters know that the likelihood of their getting caught with multiple submissions is very low; they also believe that the acceptance of abstracts is often very capricious and arbitrary and, therefore, they feel victimized by an unfair review process; and they believe that because a sufficiently large number of persons do it (or so they believe), the practice of multiple submissions is necessitated by the cut-throat competitiveness of science. But I suppose it’s not very ethical, right?","Conference planners and directors have the right to insist that submitted abstracts not be sent to multiple conferences. Presumably, the rule of exclusive submission insures that the abstract material will not have been presented elsewhere such that attendees will find value in learning it. Obviously, conference planners hope that presenting cutting edge, never-before-presented material will incentivize persons to register for their conference. Because an individual has submitted an abstract, conference planners have the right to assume that the submitter has read, understood, and is abiding by the exclusive submission rule. Consequently, when researchers submit the same abstract to multiple conferences, they violate this implicit promise and thus commit moral turpitude. The practice of multiple submissions, of course, places additional burdens on conference planners as they must recruit extra reviewers to handle the (morally tainted) surplus of abstracts. Justifying the submission of multiple abstracts on the basis that they are claimed to be essentially different from one another merits discussion, however. What criteria would count in justifying the claim that multiple abstracts are sufficiently different from one another? Some criteria would be if the content of each abstract confirms an hypothesis that is reasonably different from other hypotheses; or if the data and conclusions reflect the results of different experiments; or if the data reasonably appear to be answering different research questions; or if there are multiple sets or subsets of data that reflect or respond to either different research questions or that better inform or complement other data sets. This last example of interrelated data, however, invites the conundrum of the “least publishable unit,” where investigators sometimes segregate their into minimalist sets with each set intended for a separate publication (thus aiming for the maximum number of papers for the investigators). Determining when an instance of this practice is unreasonable seems to involve expert judgments that are too nuanced (especially because they are so context dependent) for moral discourse to say much about. On the one hand, investigators certainly have the prima facie right to maximize their publishing opportunities; on the other hand, if they do so by publishing data that are so repetitious or similar that one can discern nothing that reasonably differentiates one publication from another, these redundant publications by definition waste the pages of professional journals. In conclusion, it might be very easy for an investigator to convince himself, as reflected in the scenario above, that the practice of multiple abstract submissions is acceptable. Professional ethics would demand, however, that investigators not break their promises, which they do when they submit the same abstract to multiple conferences. Also, conference planners and staff should not be needlessly burdened by having to review abstracts whose submission violated program rules. However, when those abstracts are reasonably, essentially, or substantially different from one another, multiple submissions seem entirely acceptable (conference rules permitting). Perhaps the above criteria can be helpful in distinguishing acceptable from unacceptable multiple submissions.","%Introduction:

49,"I had decided to submit my first abstract ever for a neuroscience conference that I very much wanted to attend. My research consisted of running human subjects through an fMRI scan so as to collect brain activation data in response to simple visual stimuli. My data and analyses appeared solid as the time drew near for me to write the abstract, so I was excited and eager to proceed. My postdoc slowed me down, however, with a suggestion that I include a few more subjects in the study. I agreed but voiced a concern that the submission deadline was coming up. “Maybe you can use yourself in your study,” he said. “I mean, it’s only an abstract that you’re submitting, and you can recruit more subjects between now and the conference and make corrections accordingly.” I was uneasy about using myself as a subject. I felt it was somehow unethical even though I knew there was no way I could bias the results of the study due to the simplicity of the paradigm I was using. Luckily, I was spared the problem: The next day my postdoc recruited some subjects for the study so I avoided having to use myself. However, I still wonder what would have happened if new subjects were not recruited. It was such a simple experiment that I couldn’t have affected the results. But would recruiting myself be considered a conflict of interest or be somehow unethical?","In reflecting on this scenario, we were reminded of Hans Jonas’s famous essay “Philosophical Reflections on Experimenting with Human Subjects,” which was originally published in 1969 and represented one of the early attempts to perform bioethical analysis from a secular rather than religious or theological perspective. According to that essay, Jonas would very much approve of our young investigator’s self-recruitment. Jonas asserted that investigators themselves are ideal research participants because: If it is full, autonomous identification of the subject with the purpose that is required for the dignifying of his serving as a subject—here it is; if strongest motivation—here it is; if fullest understanding—here it is; if freest decision—here it is; if greatest integration with the person’s total, chosen pursuit—here it is…By himself the scientist is free to obey his obsession, to play his hunch, to wager on chance, to follow the lure of ambition. It is all part of the “divine madness” that somehow animates the ceaseless pressing against frontiers. So, Jonas is arguing that nonmanipulation, motivation, and acute understanding of and identification with the research goals are best exhibited by the investigators themselves. Furthermore, if we worry about whether an individual’s participation in research is justified given the risks, then the investigator’s passion and commitment to scientific discovery should remove that anxiety and recommend his or her qualifications for participation in the strongest terms possible. Complimenting Jonas’s argument, the history of scientific discovery is replete with instances where investigators recruited themselves in their experiments. Perhaps the most remarkable example is Barry Marshall, an Australian gastroenterologist who proved that most stomach ulcers are caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori by drinking a solution that contained the microbe in 1982. He and his colleague Robin Warren shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2005 in recognition of their discovery. After successful inoculation with monkeys, Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine on himself, his wife and his children. Werner Forssman was awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in medicine for his work on heart catheterization. He inserted a catheter into his vein until it reached the right atrium of his heart and then took an X-ray of the placement to prove it could work. Kevin Warwick, a British robotics researcher, implanted electrodes in his body (and later in his wife’s) that could send signals to a robotic arm. His discovery that impulses could be sent from the human nervous system to an artificial one spurred the “transhumanist” movement, which is interested in the ethical use of electronic augmentation or enhancement of the natural human body. Unfortunately, not all such self-recruitment in scientific history ended as well as these. In the early nineteenth century, Humphry Davy and Horace Wells became addicted to nitrous oxide and chloroform respectively, as they investigated their anesthesiological properties. (Davy’s chronic use incapacitated him for the last 20 years of his life, while Wells committed suicide.) Daniel Alcides Carrion died in 1885 at the age of 28 when he had a friend inject him with blood drawn from the wart of a 14-year old suffering from what was then called Oroya fever. Carrion developed the disease and died. In his honor, Oroya fever—which was at epidemic levels in Peru when Carrion studied it—was renamed Carrion Disease and the Peruvian government recognizes October 5, the day of Carrion’s death, as Peruvian Medicine Day. And then there are Elizabeth Ascheim Woolf, Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin who all died of radiation exposure from their use of X-ray technology. Ascheim and her husband set up for the first X-ray laboratory in San Francisco and experimented with the technology unaware of its dangers. Rosalind Franklin would surely have shared the Nobel Prize with Watson, Crick and Wilkins in 1962 for the discovery of DNA. But Franklin died from ovarian cancer in 1958, almost certainly as a result of her using X-ray crystallography to decipher the B form of the helical structure of the DNA molecule. Per the above scenario and pace Hans Jonas, contemporary ethics would probably recommend a very conservative course as to whether or not an investigator should recruit him or herself for an experiment. One fear is that if the investigator doesn’t suffer from the disease being studied, he or she may feel a need to acquire it in order to test his or her hypothesis, as Barry Marshall did. But an investigator’s intentionally introducing a disease into his or her body can be strikingly antithetical to the utilitarian goal of achieving net utility. If the investigator takes significant risks with his or her welfare, the promise of the research deliverable, i.e., the end for which these efforts are being sought, is frankly imperiled. Had Jonas Salk’s injection of the polio vaccine resulted in his being permanently incapacitated from the disease (or from something related), the world would have to await another discoverer, which could have taken years. One is reminded of the airline safety precaution to parents traveling with family if oxygen in the cabin is discontinued: When the safety masks drop down, first place one on yourself and then help others. Inordinate altruism may result in a self-sacrifice that can ultimately produce a significant net disutility. Arguing from a deontological perspective, research participants largely serve as a means to the end of hypothesis confirmation or the aggregation of beneficial, generalizable knowledge. Nevertheless, we try to treat research participants as ends in themselves both through the informed consent process as well as insisting on IRB protections, such that participants are not subjected to more than minimal risk (save in exceptional cases that might favorably and directly impact their welfare). Consequently, the investigator who first enrolls himself in his own trial—which is a trial of 1, of course—before going through an IRB approval process can be assuming too much risk and should be protected from his or her risky behavior. Furthermore, and contrary to Jonas’s assertion that the investigator is the one best able to give informed consent, one might argue that some researchers are so blinded by ambition or the opportunity for prestige that they are unable to offer a truly voluntary and thoughtful consent to participation in an experiment where the risks might be unreasonably high. Of course and from a purely methodological perspective, an N of 1 is just that: a single data point that can hardly count as generalizable knowledge. While some might find Salk’s injecting himself with the polio vaccine admirable—less so, his injecting his wife and especially less so his children—all it would have confirmed is that it was safe for him and his family but possibly not safe for the family next door. In the above scenario, however, safety does not appear to be a significant concern as indicated by the millions of persons who have had MRIs without incident. We worry instead about our young investigator’s participation from another angle: Might the findings on his brain function be skewed by his familiarity with the research and its purpose? On the one hand, if the investigator’s research goal is purely descriptive, i.e, motivated by an interest in discerning the neural activation patterns of a particular visual stimulus such that nothing beyond that descriptive aim is desired, then his participation is probably acceptable. On the other hand, if a research hypothesis has been forwarded, e.g., “visual stimuli of this or that sort will activate brain regions X, Y and Z,” then it might be the case that the investigator’s foreknowledge of that hypothesis can bias his neural responses to the stimuli in favor of the hypothesis. This argument is hardly idle. Commentators discussing the substitution of fMRI for polygraphy in lie detection have commented that the current state of the technology in no way argues for such (assuming it even argues for the merits of polygraphy). Just as individuals have learned to fool polygraphy, e.g., by biting their tongues or pressing their toes to the floor, they might just as well fool an MRI by concentrating on feelings, thoughts or images that, with enough know-how on their part, might produce findings that “prove” their testimony. Consequently, it appears that we should be very cautious, even hesitant, about the idea of researchers recruiting themselves for experiments. If the research posed minimal risks and there is no compelling reason to think that the investigator could skew or bias his or her test results in the direction of some research hypothesis, then his or her participation is probably acceptable. If, however, the risks are considerable and/or a biased result from the investigator’s participation is indeed possible, then that researcher’s participation would be morally problematic and so should be disallowed. Ultimately, a researcher who enrolls him or herself in an experiment before any other subjects are enrolled and especially before a sufficient amount of data collection among animals has occurred is acting rashly and is not furthering the cause of science.

50,"Here’s a troubling story. A veteran PI related how he once worked in a large laboratory that had an open floor plan (OFP). In other words, multiple labs shared space and equipment with no walls between them. The OFP was primarily in place as an administrative strategy that allowed one lab to absorb another’s lab space if the latter got recruited to another university or lost funding. The PI then described how two labs sharing the common space had become very competitive. These two labs shared a tissue culture storage area, and graduate students from either lab began to suspect sabotage from the other lab when their cell culture experiments yielded unpredictable results. Most researchers label the lid of their cell culture dishes, but when one postdoc began labeling the top and bottom of her dish, she discovered that a switch had indeed occurred. She then accused the personnel of the other lab of intentionally switching the covers of the dishes to mix up the samples. This resulted in a very painful incident with the labs accusing each other of sabotage. Finally the University had to construct walls to separate the labs. Not terribly ethical, wouldn’t you say? Your comments?","We will respond to this scenario from two, rather different vantage points or interpretational frameworks. The first one will understand this scenario as originating from nonmaleficent, unintentional, but careless behaviors that result in errors. The second understands this behavior as the deliberate sabotaging of another’s work product. Either interpretation looks to an observation by Donald Berwick about human factors and systems design: “Every system is perfectly designed to achieve the results it achieves.” Interpretation #1: “Never ascribe to malice that which can adequately be explained by incompetence.” This account presupposes that either intentional sabotage of the tissue cultures never occurred or, if it did, was triggered by some researcher’s unintentional error of carelessly switching lids of the tissue culture jars. This understanding would look to what risk management personnel call “system flaws” or weaknesses that heighten an environment’s vulnerability to failure. This phenomenon usually results from system operators—in this case, lab personnel—failing to observe customary rules, regulations, policies, protocols or standards pertaining to lab operations, which in this case involve noncontamination protocols. To the extent that researchers in this lab are relatively “unpatrolled,” they might be committing any number of noncontamination policy violations, e.g., using suboptimal sterile practices, placing lab specimens on contaminated surfaces, exposing specimens to the open air, or carelessly exposing sensitive materials (including themselves!) to radioactive, neurotoxic, or corrosive materials. These protocol violations or “technical errors” can be caused by any number of factors like fatigue, poor monitoring, inadequate training, or system operators getting used to cutting corners in attempting to be more efficient. Thus the need exists for some kind of policing of complex environments like large laboratories with open floor plans populated by numerous personnel so that the latter might strictly adhere to the usual and customary standards. Note, also, that while open floor plans might admit the advantages that are mentioned in the contributor’s scenario, their design also admits problems such as: The collegiality, or at least civility, that open floor plans anticipate might not exist; lab groups or their members might change regardless of the vicissitudes of funding; and multiple persons working in complex environments can bring varying (and often inadequate) levels of understanding to their job functions that can degrade the quality of system operations. These variables only heighten the recommendation that lab personnel be periodically reminded of and trained in noncontamination and tissue sample labeling protocols; that all lab personnel be vigilant in patrolling for such; and that they immediately intercept and correct protocol deviations. Achieving the latter is not easy because it entails the kind of collegial environment wherein system operators feel comfortable in calling attention to system weaknesses and the like. Consequently, leadership must create an organizational atmosphere of safety. Researchers who call attention to one another’s deviant behaviors or protocol violations can only do so if they feel confident that they will not suffer recriminations and that leadership will take appropriate steps to insure that deviant behavior ends. Also, some commentators argue that persons who violate protocols should not be blamed or penalized initially, unless their actions are brazen, reckless, or chronic. This discussion of how to choreograph work environments such that system weaknesses and operator errors are intercepted before harms or perils materialize is too elaborate to be discussed here, so we will alert the reader to some literature that might be helpful. We remind the reader, however, that the discussion so far assumes that the untoward event was most likely the result of careless actions precipitated by a lack of adequate adherence to noncontamination protocols. The next account will not nearly be so optimistic about human motives and professional integrity. Interpretation #2: “Always suspect the baser motive.” This account will understand the contamination event as intentionally maleficent. Unfortunately, the history of scientific investigation is replete with examples of misconduct, and it is probably unlikely for an individual who is well along in a scientific career not to have had a personal experience or brush with an incident such as the one above. In a remarkable article appearing in a 2007 issue of Science and Engineering Ethics, Melissa Anderson and her colleagues described the results of a series of focus group meetings they conducted with 51 mid- and early-career scientists. The interest of the focus sessions was to assess the effects of competition among scientists on their work and relationships. The authors’ summary statement concluded that: [C]ompetition contributes to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage or others’ ability to use one’s work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct. While competition is supposed to promote innovation and productivity by evolving a marketplace of ideas that operates in a fair and just manner, Anderson remarked that: None of the focus-group participants made reference to positive effects of competition on their work…the scientists referred to competition as a constant and negative force that interferes with the way science is done …The present analysis suggests that those who fund, manage and regulate the enterprise have underestimated the extent to which competitive pressures on scientists induce behaviors that can only be described as perverse, counter-normative and counter-productive. Other researchers have empirically observed a strong, positive relationship between the perceived level of competition in an environment such as the one described above and the likelihood that associated personnel will observe some kind of misconduct. As one of Anderson’s focus group participants put it: I think part of the problem today is it’s so much more competitive than it used to be. When we were first starting out, it was more collegial. You gave reagents away freely. Now there’s more at stake. There’s patents at stake. There is getting yourself funded. They make it so difficult to get grant money these days. And all this stuff is coming into play. And people are more secretive. People are doing things like that more, to chop their competitors, to get a leg up on them. And it’s, in a way, almost being forced to do it. Because it’s just, it’s too competitive. Especially if you’re in a hot field. It’s extremely competitive. One would hate to think that the saboteur in the above scenario simply acted out of malice, thinking that the sabotage was a great idea. But stories of purely malicious or patently unfair behaviors among members of the scientific community are endless, perhaps beginning at the undergraduate level with stories about stealing the “curve-wrecker’s” notebook in organic chemistry. Anderson remarks about how scientific competition has come to resemble the “tournament” metaphor, where a win promises to bring great dividends to the victor, even though his or her margin of victory might be extremely small. Thus, gold-medal winners in the Olympic games might go on to have multi-million dollar careers even though second-place finishers (whom no one remembers) might have lost by a few hundredths of a second. Thus, whatever results in an even modest advantage might be seriously considered, such that the less scrupulous might cave in to the temptation to augment their chances illicitly. What we have in the dilemma above is an open floor plan, different personalities with (likely) varying levels of moral integrity, very possibly an intensely competitive environment that puts people on guard and that heightens anxiety and suspicion, the distinct possibility of unintentional errors, and the realization that, ultimately, there aren’t enough good jobs in scientific research to go around. Thus, it is small wonder as Anderson remarked—and recalling Berwick’s observation on systems delivering products they are perfectly designed to deliver— that “researchers *might+ respond with self-protective and self-promoting behaviors.”Could one reduce the cut-throat nature of the open floor plan with coffee hours, opportunities for social interactions, open academic exchanges, and journal clubs”? Might ethics training conducted by authority figures that specifically addresses these kinds of vicious behaviors be helpful? Possibly, although sociopaths or the vengeful will likely not be deterred. Which brings up the uncomfortable question of how to deal with this situation. Obviously, the University’s office of research compliance (or some facsimile) would need to conduct an investigation and advise the lab on proceeding. The open floor plan might need to be revamped and adequate security and training measures undertaken to prevent future instances of contaminations. Should the culprit(s) ever be identified, they would almost certainly face expulsion from the University. The University might also notify whatever professional organizations to which the culprit(s) belong of their malfeasance. But if Anderson’s 2007 publication has accurately picked up the implications of competition from Berwick’s 1996 observation that “Every system is perfectly designed to achieve the results it achieves,” then one might contend that the root cause of this dilemma will go unaddressed. Until the hypercompetitive forces of sciences are lessened at least to the point where investigators would not consider this kind of behavior, gross scientific misconduct will probably continue. Let us only hope that it will be relatively rare.

","%Introduction:  
This dilemma highlights the ethical complexities arising from competitive environments in scientific research, particularly in open floor plan laboratories where collaboration can quickly devolve into suspicion and accusations of sabotage.

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the potential for unintentional errors due to system flaws, the impact of competition on ethical behavior, and the necessity for adherence to established protocols in lab environments. The dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the varying levels of moral integrity among researchers also play a crucial role.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
The scenario can be analyzed through two interpretational frameworks: one that views the incident as a result of careless behavior rather than malice, and another that considers the possibility of intentional sabotage driven by competitive pressures. The work of Donald Berwick on systems design and Melissa Anderson's research on competition in science provide valuable insights into these dynamics.

51,"Should We Interview Bereaved Parents? Claire Sibold, BS, Ethics Fellow Category: Participant Recruitment Case: An investigator is working on a proposal to interview parents of children who had died within one month of a cancer diagnosis. At six-month post-mortem, the investigator hopes to speak with parents to determine the causes and events leading up to the precipitous death. A substantial number of children die within one month of the cancer diagnosis, but it remains unclear why this happens. One hypothesis is that the premature death is due to delayed start of treatment because the disease initially presents with no symptoms or because there is limited patient healthcare access resulting in late contact with a care team. Before the investigator continued with the protocol development, he was told by his institution to obtain a research ethics consult to ensure the recruitment methods and interview protocol were ethically sound. While the researcher’s plan to interview parents to get more information on how to prevent these deaths in the future is commendable, the major concern is how to access and interview bereaved parents without causing undue harm.","Background: This case raises the question of how to appropriately recruit participants for and conduct interviews about sensitive topics with participants who are in vulnerable states. Topics considered sensitive include bereavement, especially of parents of young children, criminal activity, or serious illness. Conducting research interviews about sensitive topics has the potential to cause participant harm, which may compromise the ethical imperative of nonmaleficence. To ensure these research topics receive adequate attention without inciting participant discomfort or harm, it is essential the proposed interview protocol is thoroughly examined for ethical integrity. As conducting research on sensitive topics can be uncomfortable for participants, experts have also explored different channels through which sensitive topics can be discussed, such as phone interviews. Phone calls can help reduce participant discomfort, which may allow them to feel more open to discussing potentially upsetting topics. In a study exploring parent preferences about interview formats to discuss their experiences following a child’s burn injury, most people preferred phone interviews, followed by email, skype, and then face-to-face interviews. The authors also noted that several factors contributed to the parents’ willingness to participate in the various formats, which the investigator should consider in the development of their recruitment strategy. These factors include the personal convenience of the interview, participant belief in their ability to be open with the researcher despite the potential to be upset about the topic, ability to connect with the researcher, and whether or not they felt as though they could give adequate answers to the researchers. Further, there may even be some benefits to interviews on sensitive topics. Even if temporarily distressed by some of the interview questions about a sensitive topic, participants are grateful for the chance to participate in such research and would do so again in the future. The interviews can even be therapeutic–if conducted appropriately–and offer participants the space to share their feelings. There are also guidelines that specifically address port-mortem interviews. In guidelines published by the Consensus Panel on Research with the Recently Dead, the authors proposed criteria for evaluating research with the recently dead and how to do so in a way that respects both the needs of the family members and newly deceased individual. The latter point is stressed: the interview must be carefully constructed so that it shows respect for the deceased individual The guidelines also stress the importance of ensuring the benefits of conducting the research outweigh the risks to family members. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of having an interdisciplinary ethics review board examine the research, allowing them to weigh in on the unique ethical concerns that may arise. With the careful oversight of ethics review boards, several studies have been conducted with families of children who recently died from cancer. While they require a rigorous review to mitigate risk to participants and the risk benefit ratio should substantially favor the benefit to the participant, they have the potential to provide insight into important research questions. Recommendations: We recommend some revisions to the proposed protocol to ensure the well-being of the grieving family is prioritized. First, we recommend designing a comprehensive chart review at several hospitals to see if the investigator can get the necessary information about the events leading up to the child’s death without interviewing the family. This would allow the investigator to make headway on their commendable research project without burdening the families unnecessarily. If more information is needed, and the future benefits of the research significantly outweigh any potential harm to the parents, then we recommend the investigator works closely with patient advocates and/or social workers to develop a plan on how best to recruit and interview family members. Several methods can be considered, such as leveraging individuals or organizations trusted by the families to explain the study or utilizing relevant social media platforms to begin building trust early on in the research process. As the investigators develop their interview protocol, we suggest the investigators consult the following framework for conducting interviews on sensitive subject matter. First, the interviews should be piloted with patient advocates to ensure the questions are well-received. The research team should be flexible about the location and timing of the interviews to allow the parents to choose an environment that is comfortable for them, which can help with establishing rapport during the potentially sensitive discussion. We would also recommend the research team is trained on how best to manage an upset participant to provide the support they need. If the investigator–after conducting the comprehensive chart review–must conduct the parent interviews, and does so in a way that minimizes any risk and maximizes the benefits to the parents, we consider the research proposal to be ethically sound. Summary: The interview protocol must withstand a rigorous review to ensure no harm is inflicted on the family who has already endured the tremendous hardship losing a child to cancer. If all other sources of information about the events leading up to the premature death are exhausted, and if recruitment and interview protocols are carefully designed and executed using the steps outlined above to uphold the ethical imperative of non-maleficence, we do not believe this protocol will cause undue harm to participants.

52,"A researcher wants to enroll his child in the study for which he is the co-investigator. The
research enrolls healthy children as controls and involves placing the child in different positions and
monitoring blood flow. Faced with a lack of volunteers and in a time crunch to fill a final spot in the
study before funding for the research ends, the co-investigator enrolls his own child. The research group
was in an ethical bind and troubled by the idea of a co-investigator using his own child as a control.
They were concerned that the child would be coerced since she knew that the study was her father’s
job. ","Researchers have long turned to their own children for recruitment into their research. In 1954,
Jonas Salk injected his children with his newly developed polio vaccine, and the famed psychologist Jean
Piaget studied his own children in depth for his work on child development. Extreme cases of scientists
conducting research on their own children extend into modern day as well. In 2009, a front page article
in the New York Times detailed the case of a neuroscientist strapping a camera to the forehead of his
newborn child, an MIT researcher who recorded 70% of his child’s waking hours for years, and a
Vanderbilt medical professor who included all 7 of his children in his research on learning problems and
speech development. On one hand, the case detailed above is benign in comparison to some of these
more extreme examples; the control regimen proposes no harm to the participating child since it was a
minimal risk study. On the other, the co-investigator enrolling his own child into the research study still
raises several concerns, namely that of professional objectivity, patient autonomy, and informed
consent. Should children enrolled in their own parent’s research be considered an especially vulnerable
population?
A review of the literature reveals a lack of official guidance on the topic. Neither federal
research regulations nor The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) address the enrollment of
children in their parent’s research. As a result, decisions about the permissibility of such cases must be
made by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethicist. Shepherd et al. suggest two set of questions
such entities may encourage, namely a set that a researcher asks themselves when considering using
their own children for their research and a set that consent monitors can discuss with children when
obtaining assent and parental permission:

53,"Background: Accruing patients to clinical trials without health insurance raises several ethical
issues. While uninsured patients deserve the same options as their insured peers, when considering
whether to offer a clinical trial, care must be taken to evaluate the uninsured patient’s ability to afford
the standard of care treatment during the trial and his/her access to the study drug post-trial if it proves
safe and efficacious. Patients without insurance who participate in research trials may be less likely to
benefit from the findings, since the uninsured patient may be unable to afford the drug if it is approved
and marketable. This is less likely the case for cancer treatments, since these trials can last for years, but
it is a concern for research that unfolds in shorter duration such as for diabetes treatments [1]. In the
case of diabetes, uninsured patients may not be able to afford insulin, so a trial may be the only access
to medication. In cases such as these, uninsured patients may feel they have to enter the study but may
have no chance of benefiting from its results. It is worth restating that the participants should be
selected based on the scientific needs of the study and independently of the participant’s financial
status. In research ethics, justice is the fair selection of research participants; therefore, insurance status
should not be a determinant of patient eligibility. However, ethically, the patients should have the
potential to benefit from the outcome of the study in which they contributed. Therefore, the PI must be
able to evaluate and present the likelihoods of benefits and risks to these patients not only regarding
costs and side effects in the trial, but also after the trial with regards to accessibility to the agent if it
proves safe and efficacious.
Scenario: A low income family with no health insurance finds out the family member who
supports the family has been diagnosed with a malignant disease. Normally, the family pays out of
pocket for health expenses, however, affordability of treatment for this disease type is unrealistic both
due to the cost of the treatment and the patient’s inability to continue working. ","This story isn’t uncommon, as 8.8% of Americans were uninsured in 2017, with
African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics having the lowest rates of insurance coverage. By the fourth
quarter of 2018 the uninsured rate had risen to 13.7%. Furthermore, 28% of working-age adults in
the US with year round health insurance were still considered underinsured in 2016. Given the situation
of this patient, the only option for treatment may be to enroll in a clinical trial. From an investigator’s
perspective, justice must be upheld during patient accrual with the fair selection of research
participants, so it is ethical to enroll uninsured patients in clinical trials. At the same time, however,
uninsured patients don’t have the same options available to them as their insured counterparts. The
uninsured patient’s need to enroll in the trial, unknown costs not covered by the trial, and the potential
unavailability of the study drug after trial for the patient all raise concerns of exploitation. Coercion,
namely when one person overtly threatens another to gain compliance, isn’t a factor in this case.
Undue influence, however, may be. Undue influence can result when the reward for participating in the
trial is excessive and induces participation in the study when the patient would otherwise have not
enrolled. In this case, uninsured patients with less options are more susceptible to inducements
because participating in the trial may be the only affordable way to obtain treatment. It’s likely that this problem can be circumvented with a comprehensive presentation to the patient before enrollment. Not
every procedure in a clinical trial is covered by the sponsor, and the costs attributed to standard of care
will likely have to be paid for by the patient. Therefore, these costs should be presented to the patient
upfront, dispelling a possible misconception that the trial is entirely free. Alternatives to enrollment
should be presented regardless of the level of their desire to partake in the trial. These patients have
options, potentially including financial assistance for uncovered costs of the trial or of other treatment
from social work, all of which should be clearly identified and discussed with every patient prior to
enrollment. Because there are difficult ethical issues surrounding inclusion of un- and underinsured
patients in biomedical research, there is a the need for more research regarding protection and
inclusive practice with these patients.
Recommendation: The patient should be offered the clinical trial, but the informed consent
process must be extensive, including the cost of procedures not covered by the trial and an explanation
of other treatment options and how they might be paid for. A consultation with Social Work is also
recommended so that alternative sources of payment for treatment can be explored.

54,"Protocol Deviation #1: A Scary Finger Cut in the Lab
A few years ago while working in the lab, I attempted to grab a bottle of solution from a shelf.
As I absentmindedly reached for the bottle, I felt a nasty pain and saw a tear in my latex glove
with blood oozing from it. My gloved hand had brushed a broken glass pipette that was taped
to and hanging from the shelf above.
Back then, I was very anxious about my productivity and whether the PI approved my
work (and me). So, maybe not surprisingly, my first reaction was, “The PI is going to fire me!
How clumsy can I be?” But then I really got scared as the research I do involves a host of blood
born viruses. I looked at the pipette shard and noticed that it was caked with dried blood.
Blood on that pipette might have entered my system. So I ran to the sink to clean my hands,
following the biosafety protocol of a fifteen minute wash. At some point, a postdoc came along
and asked me what happened.
I thought about making up a story because what is supposed to happen in a case like
this is that I would go to Employee Health and get checked out and then report the incident.
That report would trigger a lab inspection from the Office of Biosafety. But at that moment, as I
stood over the sink feeling awful about this entire situation, the thought of bringing the Office
of Biosafety down on the lab was the last thing I wanted to have happen.
As things turned out, all of my anxieties were unfounded. I did tell the PI what
happened and, to my enormous relief, he was extremely concerned about my safety and just as
upset about the obvious safety violation. He insisted the incident be reported to the Office of
Biosafety. He then used that report to educate lab employees about the importance of
protocol compliance.
In the months that followed, I discussed the incident with some of my peers.
Interestingly, some of them immediately resonated with my fears about bringing an inspection
down on the lab. I was fortunate to have a PI who invited the inspection without hesitation and
made sure the rest of the lab workers learned something from it. But perhaps not all PIs would
react the same way. I’m also concerned that had I not spoken up (and I was sorely tempted not
to) about the protocol violation—imagine, a pipette shard with dried and probably infected
blood being taped to and hanging from a shelf!—those kinds of lapses would continue.
Why do these temptations to keep silent exist, resulting in unsafe environments
remaining unsafe? Why did a number of my colleagues share my anxiety over reporting this
(with a couple even saying they wouldn’t have reported it)? Please comment.
Protocol Deviation #2: I Should Have Spoken Up
Some years ago when I was an undergraduate, I worked in a mouse lab. The euthanasia
protocol was to place the mouse in a carbon dioxide chamber for five minutes and then take
blood and organ samples. But the technician I worked with told me when I started that the
mice usually died before the five minutes were up. His method was to remove the mouse after
about three minutes and poke it to see if it would respond. When it didn’t, he’d start extracting
blood. Unfortunately, the fifth or so mouse we did woke up when we inserted the needle and 
started screaming. The tech immediately broke its neck and no one other than me knew about
it. And that was the last time we euthanized a mouse for only three minutes.
However, at our next lab meeting, the PI scolded us for a recent and very disturbing
occurrence. A few days before the meeting, one of the graduate students had found a mouse
alive in the refrigerator where the mouse carcasses were stored. The PI told us that this was a
huge problem requiring a number of experiments to be redone; that an investigation should be
conducted; and that the individual who was responsible for this should either come forward or
be identified.
I always wondered if my lab tech was the guilty party. But at least five other persons in
the lab could have done it too. In any event, an investigation was never conducted. I was never
asked if I knew anything. And I never came forward to say what I knew. My feelings at the time
were that if the tech lost his job, he would be broke and I knew he already had financial
difficulties. I also thought he had learned his lesson.
But even now, years later, I still feel guilty over not having said anything. I often wonder
what I would have done if I was directly asked about what I knew. Was I right to protect the
technician? In fact, and as I learned later, had certain people in research administration or
leadership found out about any of this, my PI could have been in serious trouble for not
reporting the incident.
Please comment.","After they are discovered and their harm-causing if not disastrous impact becomes abundantly apparent, protocol deviations often seem unfathomable. Thus, in Protocol Deviation #1, the deviation beggars belief: Someone has taped a glass shard containing encrusted, possibly virally infected, blood to a laboratory shelf. Yet, sociologists tell us that system operators, such as laboratory personnel, usually have reasons that, at least to them, justify their deviant behaviors. A good example is protocol deviation #2, where the more experienced lab technician has found that three rather than five minutes are sufficient to euthanatize a mouse. Why waste an additional 2 minutes? The rule is inefficient. Why follow it? Research protocols—or rules, regulations, policies, standards of care and other required behaviors—generally exist to promote the safety of the involved parties, to insure that experimental results are valid and reliable, and to protect the integrity of research institutions. They are violated usually not for devious or maleficent reasons, but because 1) system operators are pressured to perform, 2) the rules strike them as counterintuitive, a drain on efficiency, or counter-productive, 3) system personnel don’t know the rules or appreciate why they exist, or 4) they believe that the rules don’t apply to them and that they have a better way. Ultimately, protocol deviations occur because they are allowed to occur. Given the above-listed reasons for protocol deviations, we suggest that there are proactive and reactive approaches that can reduce their incidence. The proactive response is to deliver more robust protocol instructions—to explain both what those instructions and why they exist. For example, if the “what” (dispose of glass shards in this way, euthanize mice by a full five-minute exposure) were explained together with the “why” (dangerous exposure to a glass shard may shut down the lab, result in a biosafety investigation, and cost far more than the time and effort to dispose of the glass shard; attempts to euthanize mice by shorter exposure may result in some live mice, an animal use committee investigation, the loss of experimental results, and cost far more than the time and effort of engaging in the full five-minute euthanization procedure), system operators might be much more protocol compliant. Nevertheless and regardless of the most robust proactive efforts, protocol deviations will occur, so it is essential to devise reactive approaches that also contribute to minimizing the future incidence of these deviations. Biosafety research indicates personnel often know about rules or protocol deviations (and their deviators) but—not surprisingly—opt not to call attention to them. The most prominent reason is that persons fear retaliation, either from the organization or from the individuals they identify as protocol violators. Collegiality or, at least, not “rocking the boat” is an immensely important value in group work, so that the employee who calls a foul on co-workers seems to violate the esprit de corps. Thus, as in Protocol Deviation #2, there is the fear that an employee accused of violating protocols might experience a serious, perhaps career-ending penalty, not to mention the psychological trauma such an event would have on the rest of the staff. Furthermore, it is natural for the individual whose task performance is called into question to respond defensively, which sometimes takes the form of accusing the accurser(s) of incompetence, malevolence, deviousness, sabotage, or jealousy. Oftentimes, as in Protocol Deviation #1, the employee who considers calling attention to a protocol deviation realizes that his or her accusation will trigger some kind of official investigation, which can be very uncomfortable to the individual’s colleagues, not to mention his or her immediate supervisor. Interestingly, the dilemma contributor of Protocol Deviation #1 was so anxious in the lab that his or her first response to the injury was not righteous indignation over its actual, protocol-deviation cause, but that the injury was his or her fault. Yet, this is not a surprising response, especially from newly-hired beginners, who are often painfully aware of their lack of experience and acutely concerned about being accepted and respected by their peers. Consequently, if protocol deviations endure in professionals’ behaviors but only become matters of grave concern when disasters occur, it behooves organizations to evolve strategies that effectively identify and eliminate unacceptable protocol deviations before they allow mishaps to materialize. But this would mean that organizations are able to create work atmospheres that are keenly vigilant about the existence of protocol deviations and aware of the barriers to speaking up about them. As was mentioned above, employees generally do not deviate from protocols because they are lazy, careless, or evil. Presumably, whoever hung the shard of glass from the lab shelf in Protocol Deviation #1 hardly intended to harm a colleague, while we see that the lab technician in Protocol Deviation #2 believes that the official protocol wastes time. The organizational lesson to take from these examples is that the oftentimes popular, knee-jerk response of penalizing rule violators is not a good idea. A better one is to evolve an organizational understanding of protocol deviations as inevitable. Humans in work situations frequently seek easier ways of accomplishing tasks; they also like to experiment with different ways of doing things; and, as mentioned above, they might not know the rules or protocols, possibly because they weren’t taught them in the first place. A corporate or lab policy that seeks first to understand why a protocol was violated is the best, initial response. Upon learning what the protocol violator’s rationale was and what variables were present that influenced his or her protocol deviation, an organization can then take action—which can be anything from agreeing that the violator’s deviation is an improvement on the extant protocol (and so should replace it) to dismissing the protocol violator for reckless and egregious behavior. Because protocol violations are profoundly contextual and can run the gamut from benign to outrageous, we cannot elaborate on what form and gravity penalties, if any, should take. We do point out, however, that protocol deviations that have become normalized or “routinized,” i.e., that are going to replace the research methodology that was originally articulated, must be reported to an IRB in case of human subjects research or an animal use committee in case of animal research as an amendment to the original protocol. Before a protocol deviation becomes normalized, however, labs should inculcate an expectation among their personnel that anyone spotting another’s protocol deviation should speak to the (deviating) individual or to a supervisor, so as to consider whether or not its degree of deviance is acceptable or not. Unfortunately, however, such “consideration” will depend on the judgment, experience, and discernment of the individuals involved, which might be inadequate to the task. Thus, in Protocol Deviation #2, the lab technician believed that decreasing the euthanasia process from 5 to 3 minutes was entirely reasonable, until that proved wrong. This underlines a profoundly upsetting aspect of protocol (or any kind of rule or standard) deviation: As noted above, protocols are usually in place for good reasons that might nevertheless be unknown to system operators. Very possibly, stipulating that the original euthanasia protocol in the second example was to last five minutes was based precisely on the experience of an animal’s having survived a euthanasia attempt lasting less. Had the researchers in the second example known that, one would think that neither would have considered lessening the time of the euthanasia process. But if a system operator has not received proactive instructions, detailing both the above-mentioned “what” and the “why” of their existence, and has never experienced or had personal knowledge of “the edge of the hazard envelope,” his or her evaluation of “acceptable risk” may well be faulty, as the second example illustrates. Furthermore, a PI who comes upon knowledge of the protocol deviation in example #2 should very much consider one consequences of failing to report it: Should the protocol deviation ever be discovered by others, the lab could easily be subject to an investigation over accusations of animal torture. Even the smallest, apparently most benign protocol deviation might merit some form of systematic review. But in order for that to happen, system operators will need to feel comfortable in speaking up. They will need to feel confident that no retaliation will result and that their action will be supported by leadership—indeed, that leadership expects such “speaking up” rather than maintaining silence. An important skill that all lab personnel should develop is learning communication techniques around “speaking up behaviors.” Because it is often unpleasant to conduct such conversations, we have included a short list of items in Table 1 that might get such conversations off to a good start. As they proceed, however, it is extremely important to maintain the distinction between the deviant behavior from the (presumably nondeviant) individual. As a minister once put it, “I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.” The lab (or corporation) that maintains that distinction will go far in creating a climate where employees might find protocol deviations a provocative learning opportunity rather than acts performed clandestinely to save time or toil. Leaders must model the kinds of behaviors that enable speaking up. Again, these include a prima facie, nonpenalizing/nonretaliatory response to protocol violations, understanding that protocol violations are inevitable, constructing learning opportunities around them, and disseminating an organizational expectation that everyone in the lab will be vigilant about and take corrective action towards problematic behaviors. Reducing protocol violations will make for better science and improved working conditions. While the risk management process involved in protocol deviations is hardly simple and never-ending, the end results surely argue for its importance. Table 1: Helpful things to say in conducting difficult conversations around protocol deviations: • “I’m sure you don’t realize this but…” • “You are very important to this organization.” • “I could be wrong here.” • “Can I explain what I’m seeing and get your point of view?” • “Right now, the way you do X would be considered risky or a departure from the standard of care” (focus on safety, not competence) • “I value our friendship/relationship, and I want us to be honest with one another.” • “My understanding is X, is that yours?” • “What do you think can be done about this?” • “I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable but when I bring up a concern, I see you tense up. Sometimes you cut me off or jump in with a disagreement. I think you stop listening and begin defending. You may not realize how you’re coming across, but that’s how it appears to me and others. Do you realize you’re doing that?”

0,"I joined a lab during graduate school and was assigned to a post-doc, who immediately had me working
with him to synthesize a key compound for his project. We worked on the compound for a number of
months with him directing the effort. However, I was pleased with my own contributions and was
delighted to get positive feedback from him. Indeed, the overall experience I was having was very
positive, making me work even harder on the project.
That’s when things got interesting. Early one evening, when we felt we were very close to
success, I decided to stay a bit longer in the lab and try out some hunches. As I systematically tried out
each one and tested it to see if it was correct, I FINALLY GOT IT. I verified it over and over to make sure.
And I was overjoyed. I wrote it up, and left the lab in the wee hours of the morning elated but
exhausted.
So I didn’t get to the lab until late the next morning, but I wasn’t concerned because I knew my
senior partner would be gratified. What do I see, however, but him talking to the PI of the project and
taking credit for my discovery of the previous evening. I walked over and was astonished to hear him
saying to the PI, “I verified the compound this morning, so we’re on our way.” Apparently, he saw my
lab notes of the evening before, duplicated my test that morning, and now was taking credit for it as his
own!
When I got him in private, I was very upset and told him that the last, crucial step in the
experiment—the one I did the previous evening—was my idea and my work. He laughed in my face and
said that I was only tinkering around with some obvious strategies and that sooner or later one of us
would finalize it. In other words, he was entirely dismissing the importance of my work the night before
and arguing that the outcome was inevitable no matter which one of us did it. So, he was claiming the
work as largely his own because the project was his and he did most of the intellectual work.
How should a lab resolve this problem? In a situation like this, who should get credit and what
should the decisional process be?","We were surprised to discover that the literature on what Nicholas Rescher has called “credit allocation rules” in science is rather scant. This is in sharp contrast to the rather large literature on assigning authorship credit, and the scandalous literature on researchers appropriating ideas from one another and then claiming credit for them. Unfortunately, the investigator who is looking for some apriori blueprint or algorithm that spells out who should get credit for what discovery and how much credit will be hard pressed to find that template. But only a little reflection is needed to suggest why that omission exists. 
Consider some of the more obvious bases or justifications for allocating credit in scientific research: originality of the research project or experimental idea; ingenuity in developing the research design; persevering through the intellectual and physical rigors of gathering data and conducting analyses; developing critical, perhaps extremely novel experimental materials; providing critical, sometimes ingenious technical support; offering novel or even brilliant insights at any point along the research trajectory; assessing the value of a particular discovery within the overall research project, (e.g., did the discovery play a modest role, or was it momentous in realizing the project’s goal?); calculating the value of the discovery’s contribution to contemporary scientific knowledge (e.g., is that knowledge expanded, refuted, or better understood in light of the new discovery? Has the discovery enabled new and promising lines of research?); and, of course, deciding the value of the scientific discovery relative to its enhancing human flourishing. As such, it isn’t difficult to discern why no apriori schema is available for ascribing values to these factors because any research project is abundantly rich with contextual details like these that would inform and differentiate case-by-case deliberations about assigning credit.
Moreover, the fact that the form of most research is highly collaborative makes for additional problems. If every member of a research team contributed “equally,” then, following Aristotle, we would treat equals as equal and give everyone equal credit. Similarly, if the project design was such that each individual’s work was equally constitutive of and essential to the end result—or each individual’s contribution was so tightly and essentially integrated with all the others’ that it would be impossible to isolate one from the other—then we would probably not hesitate to say that the credit must be shared equally.
But much research activity is not nearly so equally distributed. Different tasks are delegated to different people or different groups, each one possibly requiring different levels of expertise or contributional weights—from performing sheer “grunt” work to performing tasks that might require extremely sophisticated knowledge and skill. Thus, while one might greatly value a remarkable insight on solving a complex problem, the experiment might nevertheless be impossible without someone else’s contributing a complex reagent or a ninth generation knockout mouse. Not only do all these “contributional interdependencies” exist but as highly interdigitated, they further complicate judgments about a discrete contribution’s value. 
We would be remiss, incidentally, if we failed to note that the problem of assigning credit for a scientific discovery is rampant throughout science’s history, prompting Stephen Stigler in 1980 to enunciate Stigler’s Law of Eponymy: “No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer.” Confirmatory evidence for Stigler’s Law abounds. Alfred Russel Wallace had published papers on natural selection prior to Darwin’s 1859 masterpiece, On the Origin of Species, whose ideas might have more than influenced Darwin’s work. Gaussian distributions were not discovered by Gauss, nor was the Pythagorean Theorem discovered by Pythagoras. And to his credit, Stigler admits that Stigler’s Law was discovered by the sociologist Robert Merton.
The crux of the contributor’s dilemma involves differing interpretations about the originality and significance of the graduate student’s efforts. The post-doc understands the graduate student to be performing experiments that are obvious, straightforward and mundane. Although the post-doc would admit that the assistant’s experiments are critical to the ultimate research deliverable, i.e., the newly synthesized compound, the post-doc would probably argue that those experiments more require physical and mental stamina than scientific talent or skill. The graduate student, however, understands her experiment’s succeeding in synthesizing the compound as a virtual “breakthrough” rather than a predictable, mundane moment in the research project’s trajectory. And for that she wants recognition, i.e., credit. She sees her work as unique, skillful, and precious. The post-doc sees her contribution as menial, inevitable, and ordinary, especially in light of the project as a whole, whose creative and professional ownership he believes are his. How, then, does one resolve this problem?                                                     Let us assume that the PI is unable to adjudicate the dispute to the satisfaction of the graduate student and the post-doc. The next step might be to recruit a group of experienced scientists working in a related area of research, presenting them with the issues and disagreements of this dilemma, and requesting their opinion. A preferred, but perhaps less likely, alternative would be if the institution had installed a research ethics ombudsman or consultation group that could be involved in resolving the dispute. This approach is a distinctly Aristotelian one, looking to experienced and presumably virtuous individuals who will analyze the relevant issues and make a fair and just decision. At least two claims whose truth the group will focus on are the post-doc’s assertions that the graduate student’s experiments were “obvious” and that sooner or later, one of them would synthesize the compound without much difficulty. The committee’s considerations will likely focus on whether or not the nature of these synthesizing experiments were developed in advance, whose creative idea they were, how novel that idea was, and how complex it was to implement. Also, to the extent that the post-doc seems to want the entirety of the credit for himself, his collaboration with the graduate student must be analyzed. Was she, for instance, doing nothing but dutifully carrying out his ideas and orders, or was she contributing her own and how significant and original were they for the realizing the project’s objective? 
In his famous paper, “The Matthew Effect in Science,” Robert Merton—whom Stigler credits with coming up with “Stigler’s Law”—notes that the more famous or authoritative one is in the scientific community, the more likely he or she is to get a disproportionate amount of credit for a scientific discovery.6 Thus, Merton notes how Nobel laureates will not only sometimes refuse to place their names first on an authorship list, but might even remove their names entirely for fear that readers will simply give them all the credit and fail to notice any of the other authors. (The “Matthew Effect” derives from the passage in Matthew, 25:29: “For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.”) 
We cannot dismiss the idea that the post-doc might be suffering from a Matthew Effect or, better, a “Matthew Syndrome.” He understands himself as the authority figure here and perhaps simply assumes that he is entitled to all the credit for the research discovery. If so, then such narcissistic assumptions might need to be checked by something like the institutional procedures we are proposing here. 
Of course, there are practical challenges with all our suggestions: How likely are universities to establish a consultative process as described above? Will their faculties endorse, support, and participate in it? How likely is it that most graduate students would even argue the matter beyond the post-doc and take it to the lab’s PI (much less to a formal consultation committee)? Yet, to the extent research universities would establish and publicize such measures for resolving disputes among investigators, they might provide something of a remedy for investigators suffering from the “Matthew Syndrome.” Failing all these recommendations for resolving this dilemma, perhaps the only words of wisdom left for graduate students such as the one above are: Choose the post-doc(s) with whom you work carefully.

%Introduction:
The dilemma centers on a fundamental conflict in scientific research regarding credit allocation between a graduate student and post-doc, highlighting the challenges of recognizing individual contributions in collaborative work.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The key factors include the originality of the graduate student's experimental work, the hierarchical power dynamic between post-doc and student, the nature of collaborative research, and the distinction between intellectual leadership and technical execution. The assessment of what constitutes a significant contribution versus routine work also plays a crucial role.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The analysis draws on several important theoretical frameworks, including Rescher's credit allocation rules, Stigler's Law of Eponymy (stating that discoveries are rarely named after their original discoverers), and Merton's Matthew Effect (where established researchers receive disproportionate credit). These perspectives demonstrate the long-standing nature of credit attribution challenges in science.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The expert suggests establishing formal institutional mechanisms for dispute resolution, such as recruiting experienced scientists as independent reviewers or creating an ethics ombudsman position. The resolution process should focus on evaluating the originality of the work, the nature of the collaboration, and the relative contributions of each party.

%Key Takeaways:
Credit allocation in scientific research requires careful consideration of multiple factors and cannot be reduced to simple formulas.

This ethical dilemma revolves around the allocation of credit in a collaborative scientific research setting, where a graduate student’s significant contribution is overshadowed by a post-doc’s claim of ownership. The conflict arises from differing perceptions of intellectual and technical contributions, as well as the power dynamics inherent in mentor-mentee relationships. The situation highlights the challenges of ensuring fairness and recognition in academic research.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Several key factors must be weighed in this scenario: the originality and effort of the graduate student’s late-night work, the post-doc’s role in directing the project, and the broader context of collaborative research. Additionally, the power imbalance between the student and the post-doc, as well as the potential for miscommunication or exploitation, are critical considerations. The ethical principles of fairness, honesty, and respect for individual contributions are central to resolving this dispute.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, disputes over credit in science are not uncommon, often rooted in the ""Matthew Effect"" (Merton), where senior researchers receive disproportionate recognition. Theories of intellectual property and collaborative authorship (e.g., Rescher’s credit rules) emphasize the importance of transparently attributing contributions. This case also reflects the tension between individual ingenuity and collective progress, a recurring theme in scientific ethics.  

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
To address this conflict, the lab should implement a structured process for credit allocation. First, the graduate student should document their contributions (e.g., lab notes, timestamps) and present their case to the PI or an ethics committee. Second, the lab could adopt clear guidelines for authorship and credit, ensuring all contributions are acknowledged. Mediation between the student and post-doc, facilitated by a neutral party, may also help reconcile differing perspectives. Transparency and institutional policies are key to preventing such disputes.  

%Key Takeaways:  
This dilemma underscores the importance of clear communication and ethical guidelines in collaborative research. Credit allocation should reflect actual contributions, regardless of seniority. Institutions must foster environments where junior researchers feel empowered to assert their contributions without fear of retaliation. Ultimately, resolving such conflicts requires a balance between recognizing individual ingenuity and valuing collective effort.","This ethical dilemma revolves around the allocation of credit in a collaborative scientific research setting, where a graduate student’s significant contribution is overshadowed by a post-doc’s claim of ownership.

1,"Graduate students A and B are working on somewhat different but sometimes
overlapping aspects of the same project at the same university. Their labs are side-byside, and they share ideas often and compare data occasionally.
In one of their discussions and without realizing it, Student B suggests a novel
experimental idea to Student A. A is immediately struck by the idea’s value, but he does
not relate his insight back to B. Instead and in secret, Student A implements the idea
and begins a series of experiments and data collection. While this is happening and
some weeks later, Student B realizes the same idea. She quickly discusses it with
Student A, who, unbeknownst to B, is already well along in using it.
Student B is finishing up a group of experiments and cannot start anything new.
That allows Student A to finish his data collection and write up the results. Student A
presents a finished paper to his PI without any acknowledgement of Student B. Upon
reading the paper, Student B is enraged and claims that Student A committed plagiarism
by using a critical idea of hers without acknowledgment.
Please comment. ","Disputes over assigning credit in science are common. Often they take the form of
disagreements about “who was first” in making a finding of scientific importance. So, in
1876-77, Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur argued fiercely over who was the first to
discover the cause of anthrax. In 2003, Robert Gallo and Jean-Luc Montagnier publicly
announced they would stop arguing over who was first to discover the human
immunodeficiency virus and that they would share the credit equally. In 1962 at their
reception of the Nobel Prize, James Watson and Francis Crick committed the
unforgivable indiscretion of failing to adequately acknowledge Rosalind Franklin’s
contribution to the discovery of DNA.
The overriding cause for disputes over who was first to make an important
discovery is that most research doesn’t occur in a social vacuum, but rather in the midst
of a hard-working, global community whose member scientists are in intense
competition with one another for prestige and awards.
As such, they pay extraordinarily close attention to each other’s work by reading professional journals,
attending conferences, and exchanging ideas through professional forums. They study
and try out one another’s ideas, vary and revise them, and test new hypotheses—all the
while hoping to be first in announcing significant progress to the scientific community.
An intense concern about one’s own productivity coupled with a close scrutiny
of what one’s competitors are doing can compound the credit allocation problem
because it occasionally results in similar discoveries occurring virtually simultaneously—
not unlike what happened in the above dilemma. To take a few historical examples (and
there are many), Newton and Leibniz discovered the calculus at virtually the same time;
Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both discovered evolution; sunspots were discovered 
by four independent scientists (among them Galileo), all in 1611; and Carl Wilhelm
Schelle discovered oxygen in 1773 while Joseph Priestly discovered it a year later.
Just so, Students A and B are embroiled in a debate over credit—about who was
first to hit upon the valued idea—because they work in intensely social environments;
they have the opportunity to share, use, and test one another’s ideas, methods, and
data; and they are explicitly aware that their institution expects them to excel. How,
then, ought their dispute over receiving credit be resolved?
We might begin by attempting to determine as precisely as possible what B
initially said to A. Because A is claiming that the idea is actually his, we would need to
assess the degree to which A elaborated and translated whatever B said to him into the
experiments he eventually conducted. Unfortunately, this may be extremely difficult to
determine because of the likelihood that A and B will misremember their initial
discussion. If the function of memory is essentially reconstructive as psychologists like
to say, the chances are good that each will reconstruct the story he or she tells to suit
his or her personal ends.4
Nevertheless, if we go by the dilemma itself, the idea whose originality is in
dispute was not fully appreciated or well-formed in B’s mind during her initial
conversation with A. What presumably happened is that B speculated, mused, or
elliptically talked “around” something that then inspired a novel insight in A’s
consciousness. (So, it is easy to imagine that at that point of original discussion, Student
A understood the novel idea to be his by way of his extrapolation of B’s musings.) The
moral challenge, then, involves determining the degree of A’s originality or creativity in
translating B’s intimations into a scientific deliverable. If it turns out that A’s work
entirely derived from or simply copied the content of B’s original conversation, we
would be inclined to find him guilty of plagiarism (i.e., intellectual theft). But if his work
showed striking originality and creativity, and he only used B’s conversation as a point of
departure or inspiration leading to something strikingly original and important, we
would be inclined to credit A.
Perhaps it would be useful, then, to construct an “originality continuum.” At one
end or pole, we could place a morally unproblematic example of scientific originality,
such as one that Alexander Graham Bell reportedly made in regard to what he called the
“harmonious telegraph.”* As told by Malcolm Gladwell in a 2008 issue of the New
Yorker, Bell was consumed by the problem of the telephone and was in fierce
competition with other inventors.
 In 1874 he was spending the summer with his
parents in Brantford, Ontario and one day, he went for a walk along the banks of the
Grand River to muse over the problem. As he watched the currents of the river,
Gladwell reports that Bell “knew the answer to the puzzle of the harmonic telegraph.
Electric currents could convey sound along a wire if they undulated in accordance with
the sound waves.” Let us suppose, then, that the Grand River metaphorically
“suggested” the solution of the harmonic telegraph puzzle to Bell. But if the Grand River
had human qualities such that it could speak and learn of Bell’s appropriation of its
“suggested” idea of undulations, could it legitimately accuse Bell of stealing its “idea”?
Surely not. The “idea” that the Grand River suggested to Bell was extremely
circumscribed and infinitely removed from the way Bell used it in his invention. We 
credit Bell with the invention of the telephone because of the remarkable creativity with
which he recognized and translated the idea of the Grand River’s undulations into
telephonic technology. Analogously, then, if Student B suggested the disputed idea to
Student A in the way the Grand River suggested the solution of the harmonic telegraph
to Bell, we would dismiss B’s allegations of intellectual theft out of hand.
At the other pole of the originality continuum, however, we could posit a frank
instance of plagiarism. For example, the March 12, 2007 issue of Chemical and
Engineering News reported that Stockholm University in Sweden had sanctioned an
associate professor of chemistry, Armando Cordova, for misconduct.4
Cordova was
accused of taking research ideas he had heard at professional conferences and seminars
back to his lab, conducting (often poorly designed) experiments around them, and then
quickly gathering and publishing data without giving due credit. The gist of all the
accusations boiled down to a single complaint: Cordova committed plagiarism by failing
to acknowledge others in his publications as the originators of the critical ideas that
informed and directed his work.
The elements of Cordova’s case smack of Student B’s complaint against A. B
claims that like the presenters from whom Cordova stole ideas, she presented an idea to
A, which he then evolved into an experiment, proceeded to collect data, and then took
assumed the credit without acknowledging B’s critical contribution. Like Cordova’s
accusers, B is enraged, claims that A stole her idea, and accuses him of plagiarism.
With the Bell and Cordova cases serving as the two poles of our originality
continuum, we would then attempt to locate the originality of A’s appropriation of B’s
original discourse somewhere along it. If the findings turn out to be nearer to the Bell
end of originality or creativity, we would be inclined to exonerate A and dismiss B’s
complaint; if nearer to the Cordova end of outright intellectual pilfering, we’d be
inclined to give B the credit and penalize A. If the findings are somewhere in between,
we might resolve the dilemma by giving equal credit to both.
Note, too, that we would have to deal with B’s claim of eventually hitting upon
the idea herself. But according to the dilemma, this presumably occurred some time
after B’s original conversation with A, who claims to have had the idea from the start. In
order to substantiate A’s claim that he was first with the idea, we would have to check
his lab notebook, observe the dates of his experiments, and determine if they actually
antedated B’s hitting upon the idea. Again, questionable or unreliable memories along
with insufficient documentation might complicate this.
At any rate, an approach using these strategies might go some way to resolving
the credit assignation problem of our dilemma. It does not, however, address another
troubling aspect of this case. Students A and B are working at the same institution on
overlapping research projects. While the competition in science as to “who gets there
first” is admittedly intense, it is very disquieting when investigators from virtually the
same laboratory cannot trust one another in allocating credit fairly. And it is not only
disquieting from a principled perspective—i.e., one should receive credit proportional to
the temporal priority of her discovery and the merit of her contribution—it is
disquieting from a purely pragmatic perspective: Investigators from the same
institution who fear that a co-worker will take credit for their ideas will, by that very 
fact, be inclined to conceal their ideas from one another. That concealment might then
retard the productivity of their labs and the accumulation of knowledge that would
ordinarily result from a collective, institutional effort.
One wonders why A was so reluctant to share his insight with B. Did he fear or
profoundly dislike her? Was he convinced that if he disclosed the insight to B, its credit
would be lost to him forever? Did he lack certain skills in moral analysis such that he
was unable to articulate why the idea, as well-formed, belonged to him? Did he lack
negotiation skills that would enable him to describe the insight to B and then propose
that they work on the idea together, with him as the primary investigator? One is
reminded of so many authorship disputes that attest to communication failures among
the investigators to decide such issues before a paper is begun. Once the paper is
written, however, investigators emerge from the lab’s woodwork, claiming authorship
credits for the flimsiest of reasons.
Labs confronted with these kinds of issues, and we suspect they occur relatively
often, should consider communication skill building among their personnel, especially
involving negotiation and conflict resolution strategies. While it can be somewhat
unpleasant, anticipating how conflicts and disagreements can arise and deploying
preventive strategies before quarrels get started is obviously the best approach. Good
lab directors, then, should be acutely sensitive to the problem of allocating credit for
discovery as discussed here. When investigators fail to appreciate the intensely social
ways that scientific discovery proceeds and the moral problems that can result, nasty
problems over assigning credit should be expected.
All of this bears on the moral formation of Students A and B. If the lab director
simply dismisses Student B’s accusations and complaints without any response, what
effect will this have? Stockholm University was itself criticized for letting Armando
Cordova off lightly. His sanction consisted of his attending an ethics course and having
to present all his papers intended for public consumption to his dean for review before
he submitted them to journals. Yet, the report on Cordova’s misconduct indicates that
he continues to take credit for work that is not his.5
 His professional trajectory is
obviously threatened by these events and to the extent that he is a talented and hardworking scientist, his misbehaviors can end an otherwise promising career.
Typical penalties for plagiarism include disgrace, humiliation, ostracism and
other “shaming penalties.”
 Because it is obviously preferable to never have to call
upon these interventions, laboratory leadership has the responsibility to be keenly
vigilant about and responsive to alleged improprieties about misconduct; to include
ethics seminars and case discussions in the curriculum; to initiate skill building exercises
focusing on communication and negotiation as mentioned above; and, when they occur,
to adjudicate disputes with Solomonic wisdom. These are considerable expectations.
But universities cannot disavow their responsibility to graduate scientists who are not
only technically competent but who are adept at exercising moral sensitivity and insight. 
*We are aware, incidentally, that some historians might fault our using the Bell example
as one of morally unblemished originality. They might point out that Bell sometimes
visited the Patent Office in Washington, DC, whereupon after one such visit, he made a
sketch in his notebook of a transmitter that was identical to the one his arch rival, Elisha
Gray, had just filed in the Office. Did Bell, as Seth Shulman contends in his revisionist
account of the invention of the telephone, The Telephone Gambit, steal a critical idea in
the telephone’s invention from Gray? Was he as morally above reproach as we are
making him to be? Perhaps not. In the essay above, though, we are only assuming that
his ideas on sound wave undulations, as suggested by the Grand River example, were
clearly his and not a competitor’s.

","%Introduction:
This case presents a complex dispute over intellectual credit between two graduate students, highlighting the challenges of attribution in collaborative scientific environments where ideas are frequently shared and developed.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
- The initial conversation where Student B unknowingly suggested the idea
- The timing and documentation of when each student realized the idea's potential
- The degree of originality in Student A's implementation
- The social and competitive nature of scientific research
- The lack of clear communication between the students

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The history of science is rich with similar simultaneous discoveries and credit disputes, from Newton and Leibniz's calculus to Darwin and Wallace's evolution theory. These cases demonstrate how scientific progress often occurs in parallel within competitive research communities, making credit attribution particularly challenging.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
- Establish an ""originality continuum"" to evaluate the degree of creative transformation
- Review laboratory notebooks and documentation to verify timing
- Implement communication and conflict resolution training in labs
- Create institutional mechanisms for addressing credit disputes
- Consider shared credit when appropriate

%Key Takeaways:
Scientific discovery is inherently social and collaborative, requiring clear communication and established protocols for credit attribution. Prevention through proper documentation, open dialogue, and ethical training is preferable to resolving disputes after they arise. Laboratory leadership must actively foster both technical competence and moral sensitivity among researchers.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma highlights a conflict over intellectual credit in scientific research, where overlapping ideas and competition can lead to accusations of plagiarism.

2,"David is a new postdoc in Dr. Goliath’s lab. Upon David’s arrival to the lab, Dr. Goliath assigned
him a few experiments to firm up some results of a paper that had been rejected by a journal.
These experiments had not been performed because the technician who was working on the
project and was the rejected paper’s first author had since left the lab. David was given a copy
of the (rejected) manuscript to review and to assess what needed to be done for a second
submission. After reading the paper, David felt that the quality of the writing was poor and
that, along with including the results from the control experiments Dr. Goliath asked him to do,
the manuscript needed to be completely re-written.
David expressed all this to Dr. Goliath, who agreed that David should take ownership of
the paper and improve it. Upon completing and adding the results of the control experiments
and then re-writing the original manuscript entirely, David re-submitted the paper without
consulting the original author who had performed the bulk of the work of the original
manuscript. The reviewers gave enthusiastic reviews of the re-submission and the paper was
accepted with minor revisions
Was it appropriate that David replaced the original author as first author? Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab? Should the technician
have been informed about the changes to the manuscript prior to the new submission? Should
the technician have been invited to comment on or contribute to the new submission?","A key source of ethical guidance in resolving this dilemma is the opinion of the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which recommends that:
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and
design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of
the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3 … Each author
should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for
appropriate portions of the content. Suppose that the original, lab technician author found out about the successful re-submission
of the paper and complains that he is no longer first author. (Indeed, we are not told whether
he was retained as an author at all, but let us assume he was.) Using the ICMJE’s authorship
criteria, how might an ad hoc committee (or reasonable facsimile) resolve such a complaint?
Certainly, a key issue in deliberating over who should be first author must revolve
around the re-submission’s “intellectual content.” We are told that David performed new
control experiments, whose findings he included in the re-submission, and that David also
completely re-wrote the original paper. But if this is the extent of David’s work, then the lab
technician seems to be able to make a strong claim to be retained as first author—that is, if his
original “contribution,” i.e., the experimental design, and most of the data and their analyses
and interpretation, were substantially if not “phraseologically” retained in the re-submission
and constituted the bulk of the re-submission’s findings.
To appreciate this, consider the following hypothetical situation: Instead of assigning
the do-over of the paper to David, suppose Dr. Goliath has a graduate student perform the new
control experiments. Upon collecting that data, Goliath then hires a ghost writer/copy editor
(who is not a professional scientist) and says, “Here’s a rejected manuscript with some new
data. I want you to re-write this paper as best you can and incorporate the data from these
new experiments.” Now, it is quite possible that this copy editor could produce a paper very
similar if not identical to David’s, but we would probably hesitate giving him an authorship
credit at all, much less assigning him first authorship.
Consequently, a crucial question that an ethical review of this case would have to
address is: How different and elaborate must the intellectual content of David’s resubmission
be from the original in order for David to replace the lab technician as first author? Did the
overall conception and design of the original paper’s experimental approach change
significantly with the re-submission? Were the data analyzed and interpreted differently?
Were new implications of the data presented?
The outcome of this analysis would answer the above question about the propriety of
David’s replacing the original author as a new first author. As to the question, “Was David in
the wrong to have totally re-written the manuscript without the permission of the technician
who had written the original (rejected) paper prior to leaving the lab?” we say, “Probably not.”
Considered as intellectual property, the original, rejected paper and its ideas belong and have
always belonged to the lab, so that David doesn’t need the technician’s permission to revisit the
original paper.
This is a very important point if the University would ever wish to patent any
aspects of the materials of the original paper (regardless of whether it does or doesn’t appear
in a professional journal). The University owns and has always owned the paper’s ideas and
discoveries such that had the original paper been submitted and been accepted but the lab
technician had left the lab for a new position in the meantime, he or she would have to reveal
the fact that the research was conducted at the University while he was employed there, and
not give the erroneous impression that his new employer—whose name would certainly appear
on the paper as his current employer—owns the paper’s content as intellectual property. In
sum, the University, through Dr. Goliath, seems certainly within its rights to re-assign the
rejected paper to someone else and to have that individual revise the paper accordingly.
However, we strongly believe that the technician should have been invited to respond
to the revision before it was re-submitted—both to respond to its content as well as to his
losing first-authorship. Indeed, it seems remarkably unprofessional as well as a violation of the
ICMJE’s guidelines to place the tech’s name on the re-submission—if that in fact happened—
without his having reviewed and approved it. A pre-submission communication from David to
the technician should have informed him of the revision, explained why he (David) deserves
first authorship, and invite the technician to contribute to the revision. As occurs so often in
these kinds of cases, treating an original research contributor as though he or she no longer
exists explains how so many of these disputes originate.
So, let us conclude by returning to the issue of assessing the scope and content of
David’s revision. If we imagine an authorial continuum whose one pole is a vastly re-written
but nevertheless relatively intact preservation of the lab technician’s original intellectual
contribution(s) with the other pole of the continuum a completely new version of the original
paper’s experimental design, data, and findings, then first authorship should be determined
according to which pole on that authorial continuum (represented by David at one end and the
lab technician at the other) the resubmission’s content veers and lands. As this dilemma might
play out, however, it would be easy to imagine the lab technician’s ire should he read the resubmission’s eventual publication and exclaim, “But these are mostly my ideas and data! And I
was never contacted!” Again, some thoughtful communications among David, Dr. Goliath, and
the lab technician prior to the revision’s being re-submitted is the preferable approach to take.
","Here's the structured analysis:

%Introduction:
This case centers on authorship rights and proper attribution in academic publishing, specifically when a manuscript undergoes substantial revision by a new contributor after initial rejection.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The extent of intellectual contribution from both the original technician and David must be evaluated. Key considerations include the ownership of intellectual property, the significance of experimental design versus writing quality, and the balance between technical execution and conceptual development. The addition of new control experiments and complete manuscript revision also factor into authorship rights.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) provides the theoretical framework for resolving this dilemma through their three main criteria for authorship: substantial contributions to conception/design/data, article drafting/revision, and final approval of publication. This established guideline helps determine proper attribution and authorship order.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The recommended approach involves: 1) Evaluating the extent of changes between original and revised manuscripts, 2) Communicating with the original technician before resubmission, 3) Offering opportunity for input on the revision, and 4) Determining authorship order based on relative intellectual contributions. Professional courtesy demands including all significant contributors in the revision process.

%Key Takeaways:
While the university owns the intellectual property, ethical scientific practice requires respectful treatment of all contributors. Clear communication between parties is essential. Authorship decisions should be based on substantive intellectual contribution rather than just writing quality. The case highlights the importance of establishing clear authorship protocols in academic research settings.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma centers on authorship and ethical responsibilities in scientific research, particularly regarding the re-submission of a manuscript after significant revisions and the implications of replacing an original author.', 'Key Factors': ""Key factors include the substantial contributions to the manuscript's intellectual content, the ownership of ideas within a lab setting, and the ethical obligation to communicate with all contributors regarding changes to their work."", 'Historical & Theoretical Perspectives': 'The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) provides guidelines for authorship that emphasize substantial contributions, critical revisions, and final approval.

3,"A PI moves his lab to a different university, but a few of his postdocs and students stay back.
Once settled in, the PI decides to rewrite manuscripts already in preparation, changing the
authorship order to favor those who joined him. He also reserves the right to prohibit
publication of any research conducted in his old lab, on the presumptive authority of his role as
PI.
Is this ethical? Please comment.","At first blush, this PI certainly seems to be a vindictive fellow, trying to “punish” his former
graduate students and postdocs for not accompanying him to his new lab by rewriting their
manuscripts so as to diminish or delete their authorship status or claims. If the ethical propriety
of his rewriting was challenged, would he be able to defend himself in any kind of morally
convincing way?
Our response would inquire whether the PI’s rewriting of the manuscripts resulted in an
occasional change of wording or phraseology or whether it resulted in a considerable overhaul
of the papers’ intellectual content. If the papers’ experimental designs, methods, data
gathering, analyses, findings, and implications remained essentially the same after the PI’s
rewrites—such that the original content of the papers remained unchanged—then his behavior
seems disreputable. To the extent that the disfavored investigators’ contributions were
intellectually and substantively retained (and only reworded), their position on the authorship
list should remain unchanged. On the other hand, suppose the PI was unhappy with the work
of the students-who-stayed-behind, deciding that their contributions reflected “poor science.”
His rewrites might be justified if he then proceeds to delete their work or replace it with new
material that they didn’t contribute. To really pass ethical muster, however, he should be able
to make his case for rewriting to some committee or the Office of Research Compliance.
Questions over the second issue of this dilemma, namely about the PI’s claiming a right
to prohibit publication of any research conducted in his lab, might also go to the University’s
Office of Research Compliance. We believe that in instances where the PI and members of his
research team part ways, the individuals who performed the research should retain a moral
right to publish without the PI’s permission, as long as the authorship credits accurately reflect
the investigators’ contributions, are presented in good faith, and comply with the standard
rules on authorship.
As noted in any number of these website cases on authorship, university-based
investigators ordinarily do not own their research—their University does, assuming the grant
award came to it, which is usually the case.
 The research team serves as the University’s subcontractors/employees who promise to execute the research program described in the grant application. Thus, when a PI “takes” a grant with him or her to another institution, it is only with the permission of the University to which the grant was originally awarded. Indeed, the University reserves the right to retain the grant and appoint a new PI. Universities will sometimes not exercise that option upon a PI’s departure, however, because the University might be unable to persuade the grantor that it (the University) could adequately replace the PI and the departing research team so as to keep its contractual promise to do the research. Also, just as universities might “lose” grants when a PI takes a grant and his research team to another institution, so universities “get” grants when new hires bring research awards with them. From a purely ethical perspective, however, a PI’s belief that he has the right to prohibit publications from his laboratory solely because he is the PI is not convincing. From an ethical perspective, the PI must have substantive reasons, usually targeting the quality of the paper’s science, to justify withholding it. As long as a publication is submitted in good faith and complies with the usual expectations of authorship, PIs should welcome rather than prohibit the submission of such publications from their labs. After all, their professional responsibilities include not only discovering and disseminating scientific knowledge but advancing the careers of their laboratory personnel.
Our impression is that PIs often succeed in blocking such publications on pragmatic
rather than moral grounds. For example, an investigator who believes she has written an
excellent paper but wishes to remain employed in a lab will probably not stand up to the PI who
opposes her submitting it. Although she could submit the paper regardless, her PI would likely
become upset upon her doing so and might initiate some punitive action against her.
In the above scenario, however, the PI cannot directly harm his research team members
who stayed behind. Should they wish to submit manuscripts on their own, however, they
would have to consider whether the PI merits an authorship credit per his contribution. If the
PI did make such a contribution but forbids the submission, the authors might just delete the
PI’s contribution from the manuscript—which might prove impossible if the PI conceived and
directed the bulk of the research program. If the investigators could ethically effect such a
deletion and still wish to proceed with the submission, they could exclude the PI as an author
and instead acknowledge him or her at the end of the manuscript —in which case professional
courtesy would require contacting the PI and informing him of the intended submission. At
that point, it is hardly inconceivable that the PI might submit a blistering note to the journal
condemning the manuscript, which could easily doom its chance of publication.
Finally, if the research team would decide to submit the manuscript without any
mention of the PI, they would be well advised to confer with their superiors and perhaps the
University’s Office of Research Compliance. That office might decide, for example, that if the PI
can take his grant with him to another institution, then that implies that he can exert a strong
ownership claim over the data and hence control its dissemination. Thus, even if his intentions
to control publications are maleficently motivated, a PI might be able to block publication of
any papers coming out of his lab because his “ownership” of the data endures.
It is easy to see, then, how these pragmatic considerations and possibilities might
dissuade investigators from submitting papers in opposition to their PIs’ wishes. Yet, if such a
manuscript is actually a solid piece of work, then the losers from its nonpublication are not only
the research team members who wrote it, but the scientific community that is denied the
research findings and, by extension, whoever might someday practically benefit from them.
The easiest way to have averted this entire mess, of course, would have been to have
negotiated all these authorship issues between the PI and his investigators prior to the PI’s
departure. As the case actually unfolded, though, it seems we have a PI whose understanding
of fairness is overwhelmed by feelings of vindictiveness and narcissistic wounding. In response, 
he reverts to morally objectionable strategies to maintain his sense of power. This is the darker
side of scientific work that academic institutions should take into account when they educate
their scientists on responsible conduct in research. While PIs obviously exercise authority, its
fundamental purpose should be focused on doing good research and good science. There is no
reason why the exercise of authority cannot be tempered by a keen sense of humility.
Tyrannical PIs like the one above might indeed be productive, but they hardly qualify as ethical
role models.


","Here's the structured analysis with the requested formatting:

%Introduction:
This case presents an ethical conflict regarding authorship rights and research ownership when a PI relocates, highlighting the tension between institutional authority and moral obligations in academic research.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The main factors include the extent of manuscript revisions (superficial vs. substantial), ownership of research data, institutional rights over grant-funded research, and the ethical obligations of PIs toward their team members' career development. The PI's motivation and potential abuse of power also play crucial roles in evaluating the situation.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The case reflects longstanding issues in academia regarding research ownership and authority. Universities, not individual PIs, typically own research conducted under their auspices, especially when funded by external grants. This institutional framework has evolved to balance the interests of all stakeholders while promoting scientific progress.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
Several approaches are recommended:
- Engage the University's Office of Research Compliance to mediate the dispute
- Review the extent and nature of manuscript changes to determine if they're justified
- Negotiate authorship issues before PI departure
- Consider submitting papers independently while acknowledging the PI's contributions
- Document all substantive contributions to establish clear authorship rights

%Key Takeaways:
While PIs have significant authority, this power should be exercised ethically to advance science and develop junior researchers' careers. Institutions should establish clear protocols for handling such transitions and disputes. Pre-emptive discussions about authorship and publication rights can prevent such conflicts. The case demonstrates how personal vindictiveness can compromise scientific integrity and professional development.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma highlights the ethical implications of authorship and publication rights in academic research, particularly when a principal investigator (PI) attempts to manipulate authorship and control publication after relocating to a new institution.', 'Key Factors': 'Key factors include the integrity of authorship, the moral rights of researchers to publish their work, the nature of contributions to manuscripts, and the ethical responsibilities of PIs towards their research teams.', 'Historical & Theoretical Perspectives': ""The situation reflects longstanding issues in academic authorship, where power dynamics can lead to unethical practices.

4,"George Washington is one of two postdocs working in Dr. Big’s lab. The other postdoc, Dee
Nye, is older and has more years of experience than George, but although she is approaching
the end of her postdoc term, she has no first-author publications nor has she received any
extramural grants. Because Dee will need to leave the lab soon and find a position elsewhere,
there is a keen desire on her and on Dr. Big’s parts to make her marketable. Compounding her
overall lack of productivity is the fact that Dee does not get along very well with her coworkers; her presentations are poorly delivered; and her experimental designs are frequently
flawed.
Dr. Big likes George and tells him that he (i.e., Dr. Big) has taken it upon himself to write
a manuscript with Dee as primary author and that he will create all the necessary figures, albeit
using Dee’s data. He also tells George that he has written a rather complimentary letter for
Dee and embellished her qualifications in order to improve her job prospects.
George thinks that it is exceedingly unfair that Dee can be so unproductive and
unprofessional in the lab, yet emerge from this with someone else writing her manuscripts and
providing a glowing letter of recommendation. When he confesses this to Dr. Big, Dr. Big
answers, “I know, I know. But someday you’ll have to manage a situation like this, and you’ll
just want to be rid of this person. Besides, if I want to make her the first author on a paper, I
have that authority, don’t I?”
George is not convinced by Dr. Big’s argument, but he isn’t going to quarrel with Dr. Big
and he certainly won’t miss Dee Nye. Nevertheless, Dr. Big’s behaviors seem ethically
problematic. Please comment.","Dr. Big might be a fine scientist, but he’s not a good mentor. First, he plans to write a
recommendation letter that will frankly misrepresent Dee’s abilities and interpersonal
behaviors. The practical consequence is that her inadequacies might well follow her to her next
job and continue to cause problems. Dr. Big might argue that he’s working on Dee’s behalf,
thinking perhaps that she just needs more time to develop a more mature set of professional
behaviors. One could alternatively argue, though, that Dr. Big is primarily motivated to be rid of
Dee, and that his true motivation is self-serving (which rarely, if ever, serves as an ethical
justification). Rather than undertaking the effort to improve Dee’s professional conduct and
skills, he takes the less effortful path of misrepresenting her conduct and accomplishments.
(And we are assuming that Dee performed inadequately as described. But is her less than
stellar performance in some way attributable to Dr. Big’s very limited capacity to be a good
supervisor? Did Dr. Big allow and support Dee’s exploring her scientific interests or did he have
her doing relatively unproductive work in the lab, perhaps for his own gain?)
Second, Dr. Big is going to write a paper for Dee and position her as first author. This
will count as a second misrepresentation of Dee’s ability, assuming Dr. Big makes the primary 
intellectual contribution. Of course, it co-opts Dee into committing the same,
misrepresentational offense. Dr. Big is exaggerating Dee’s contributions to the paper, and his
argument that he has the authority to do so certainly doesn’t pass ethical muster. If authority
admits moral connotations—such that the appropriate exercise of authority consists in
modeling moral behavior and insisting that one’s charges do the same—then Dr. Big is
confusing moral authority with power. One is reminded of Socrates’ famous question in the
dialogue Euthyphro: “Is something good because the Gods approve it, or do the Gods approve
of something because it is good?” If Dr. Big is one of the “Gods,” he needs to exercise his
authority in accordance with ethical concerns about the integrity of his lab, his institution, and
all the relationships that are at stake (including the one with Dee’s future employer). Just
because he has “godlike” power doesn’t mean his exercise of it is automatically good.
Third, Dr. Big shares all of this with George, the other postdoc in the lab. Surely, this
counts as an unprofessional conversation. One might see it as a “boundary violation” in that it
muddies the relationship between Dr. Big and George—i.e., George has now become Dr. Big’s
confidant rather than just a mentee. Also, his confiding in George suggests that Dr. Big might
have some uncomfortable awareness of the wrongfulness of his conduct, so he chooses to
confide in someone who, predictably, will not call him on it. By revealing this all to George, Dr.
Big perhaps relieves his conscience, but he takes the less-than-responsible course by passing
this information along to a predictably benign, passive, and nonthreatening individual.
Worse, however, is that just as Dr. Big has co-opted Dee into misrepresenting her
authorship, his confiding all this to George makes George complicit in the misbehavior: If Dr.
Big and Dee’s misrepresentations are ever discovered, and George’s foreknowledge of their
intentions and actions becomes known, he might be harshly penalized for failing to call the
organization’s attention to this turpitude.
For all these reasons, it is difficult not to come down hard on Dr. Big. Quite possibly,
had he intervened in ways that a committed and skilled mentor would when the first signs of
Dee’s professional and relational deficits became apparent, this unpleasant scenario could
have been avoided. Did Dr. Big suffer from excessive optimism, thinking that somehow, as the
years passed in his lab, Dee’s behaviors would magically improve without the need for any
explicit intervention? Indeed, was Dr. Big ever trained in mentoring so as to know what to do
when mentees like Dee first begin presenting problems?
This invites the suspicion that Dr. Big may well be part of an institution that is aiding and
abetting his failures. The institution may be failing to: 1) provide training to its scientists in
mentoring skills in the same way that institutions typically provide ongoing training on grantgetting skills; 2) monitor mentoring conduct, by soliciting reports from mentors about their
mentoring activities and soliciting feedback from mentees about the same; and 3) reward
appropriate mentoring conduct as it rewards success in winning grants, invitations to present
high-profile lectures, membership invitations to prestigious professional associations.
Dr. Big‘s poor mentoring speaks to the need for training programs to be designed and
made available for all persons stepping into a mentoring role, lest one make the huge
inferential error that because someone is a competent and productive scientist, he or she ipso
facto has the pedagogical and management skills to be a decent mentor.
Ultimately, mentorship skills are considerable and complex, and should not be shrugged
off. Mentees deserve very capable supervisors, especially as they progress towards being 
responsible, independent scientists who might, someday, be faced with mentoring challenges
of their own.","Here's the structured analysis:

5,"Some years ago, I worked as a bronchoscopy technician on a lung transplant service.
This service maintained a very aggressive post transplant surveillance regimen that was
formally connected with the hospital's translational research efforts.
After lung transplantation, patients were seen 9 or 10 times over the course of
the first year. They routinely had bronchoscopy, which included a saline flush whereby
tissue from the lobe could be collected and then analyzed for signs of infection or
rejection. Additionally, patients underwent transbronchial biopsies with the tissue sent
to pathology for evaluation of developing allograft rejection. The tissue was also sent to
the research labs for collaborative translational studies. Patients also went through a
series of breathing tests, thoracic CT scans, and blood draws during their regular check
ups.
This aggressive follow-up was not without controversy. Many, probably most, in
the field believed it was necessary to detect rejection or infection early so as to
intervene rapidly and as effectively as possible. Others felt that these patients should
be left alone after transplant unless symptoms actually arose. I recall one transplant
group in particular claiming that their center's overall post transplant survival times are
just as good as those at centers that use the more aggressive regimen.
I believed that it was an honest question as to whether the aggressive
management at my facility was, in fact, providing better patient care. The central
problem was that lung graft survival times are less than desired overall and have not
changed much over the past decade. More research is needed to better understand
and be able to predict and treat episodes of lung allograft rejection before total graft
failure occurs and the patient dies. So, it is certainly fair to say that while aggressive
management for both clinical and research purposes might have problematically put the
patient at an increased risk without immediate personal benefit, transplant knowledge
gained through the diligent and extensive collection of clinical and biological data is the
only way to better understand the pathology of lung allograft rejection and why some
treatments do or don't work. Of course, the most likely beneficiaries of this knowledge
will be future patients, not the ones we are currently treating.                                                                                                      The second ethical problem with this research was the collection of lung alveolar
tissue by transbronchial biopsy for both clinical and research purposes. This is a
procedure that poses serious risks with even the possibility of death. However, the
procedure is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of lung allograft rejection. The
problem is that while we wanted to take biopsies for both clinical as well as research
purposes, sometimes the decision had to be made to skip one or the other because of
an occasionally limited ability to obtain tissue.
Multiple biopsies are the gold standard because rejection can be occurring in a
portion of the lung not sampled, thus leading to false negatives. But when the tissue
samples at a particular visit only go to research and the patient eventually goes into
rejection, I have wondered whether we would have caught some of the false negatives
sooner had the samples only gone to the clinical lab.                                                                                                            Perhaps there is no ethical solution to these issues because lung transplantation
is hardly a perfect science. But there certainly seems to be ample room for ethical
reflection on the somewhat conflicting stakes between research and patient care, and
the clinical uncertainties that are part and parcel of lung transplantation. ","One of the problems posed by this dilemma is whether or not it was ethically acceptable
to subject transplant patients to a highly aggressive post-transplant regimen of
procedures to check for allograft rejection. One might argue, as the dilemma
contributor does, that this regimen, which included tests of a purely research as well as
clinical nature, might have disposed patients to excessive or unreasonable risk (not to
mention the unpleasantries involved). Of those tests that serve a purely clinical value,
however, we are of the understanding that “surveillance” bronchoscopies with multiple
(i.e., at least 6) transbronchial biopsies for early detection of clinically occult acute
rejection are the gold standard worldwide, as the number and intensity of acute
rejection episodes are the strongest predictors of subsequent graft dysfunction and
patient death. While there may be some investigators who claim equal results without
this amount of follow-up, those claims do not seem to represent mainstream transplant
understanding and practice. Moreover, our experience with transplant recipients has
shown that they very much desire aggressive follow-up. Consequently, we find the
author’s argument, i.e., that aggressive clinical follow-up is probably what the standard
of care should require, compelling. But what about those tests that are purely of a
research nature—the ones where, according to the dilemma contributor, “the likely
beneficiaries of this knowledge will be future patients, not the ones we are currently
treating”?
If the risk burden of these tests, as measured by the quantity and gravity of
adverse events or complaints, is not deemed excessive or unreasonable by the
institution’s IRB or office of clinical trials, participants simply must be appraised of their
dual role as 1) patients about to undergo transplant and 2) research participants whose
post-transplant experiences will be closely monitored for scientific purposes. They
must be informed that certain of the tests they experience will not help them personally
but will rather help researchers develop better transplant interventions for future
patients.
Acknowledging research participation by way of these informed consent
considerations suggests that patients be allowed to opt out of them, or that they can
rescind their consent at any time. At Emory University, for instance, the physician
performing a bronchoscopy for research purposes confirms that the patient has a signed
research consent form on file and asks at each visit if the individual still wishes to
participate.
The dilemma contributor’s transplant center is having patients fulfill both
research as well as clinical roles, which those patients have a perfect right to know
about. Indeed, one cannot imagine that the informed consent documents these
patients sign would omit that information. Furthermore, one would hope that the
various professionals who are seeing these patients are clearly distinguished from one 
another as clinicians and investigators. To the extent, however, that many of them,
especially physicians, play both roles, conflicts of loyalty can easily occur that could
compromise informed consent discussions with patients. It is possible, in other words,
that clinician-investigators might pose informed consent conversations in such a way
that patients feel they have no choice but to acquiesce to the research studies, or they
might not be made sufficiently aware that certain of the tests have no clinical benefit for
them. The former is coercive while the latter is deceptive. Both, of course, are
unethical.
But the dilemma contributor raises a second problem per his suspicion that
biopsied material was occasionally sent only to the research arm of the study and not to
the clinic, which might have harmed certain patients who went into rejection. While we
will never be able to tell with sufficient confidence whether this investigator’s worries
are legitimate, it is hard to think that the research protocol in this case as vetted by the
institution’s IRB would not have stipulated the frequency and amount of tissue that
would need to be taken to satisfy both patient protection requirements as well as
research objectives. If the actual implementation of the protocol sometimes did not
accommodate or satisfy those stipulations, then it is easy to indict a lack of reporting or
oversight on protocol adherence as the culprit. Note, also, how this recalls the conflict
of loyalty mentioned above: that if a health professional was assigned to care both for
the patient’s clinical needs as well as collect tissue for research, he or she risks
becoming compromised by conflicting demands. (And it would not be terribly difficult
to imagine him or her rationalizing a decision that favors research interests, especially if
the investigators feel very pressured to collect adequate material.)
Still, an IRB would never allow the participants’ personal welfare to be
subordinated to their value as research subjects. So, if a conflict ever had to be
adjudicated about prioritizing where the patient’s tissue would go if it could go to only
one place, i.e., to a research lab or a diagnostic lab, morality would dictate the latter
over the former.
If the technician observed the clinical care of patients being compromised by the
investigators’ research interests, he should have reported it. This brings up the question
as to whether he didn’t think it his job, or that he feared reprisals for doing so, or that
he believed that reporting wouldn’t make a difference. Ideally, everyone on the
research team should feel comfortable bringing up concerns like this, but we know in
practice that such “speaking up” can be excruciatingly difficult to do, especially if, as was
the case here, the would-be whistleblower is someone without much power. On the
other hand, the dilemma contributor might have simply understood his concerns to be
nothing more than uncomfortable suspicions that ultimately lacked evidence. This
leaves us with the interesting and provocative question as to: At what point does a
population like this become “sufficiently” endangered by having their lung tissue go
clinically unexamined because, say, it is diverted to research? Until that question is
confidently answered, moral reflection over the quality of patient protections, the
possibly reckless endangerment of patients, and the design of and adherence to
biobanking protocols will remain inconclusive.

This ethical dilemma revolves around the tension between aggressive post-transplant surveillance for research and clinical purposes versus a more conservative approach focused solely on symptomatic care. The central issue is balancing the potential benefits of extensive data collection for future patients against the immediate risks and burdens imposed on current patients, particularly when procedures like transbronchial biopsies carry significant hazards.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the risks of invasive procedures (e.g., biopsy complications), the uncertain clinical benefit of aggressive surveillance, and the trade-off between individual patient welfare and broader scientific progress. Additionally, the dilemma highlights the challenge of allocating limited tissue samples between clinical diagnostics and research, which may impact patient outcomes.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, medical research has grappled with the ethical principle of beneficence (doing good) versus non-maleficence (avoiding harm).

6,"Jane is a very motivated and bright graduate student who is trying hard to purify a protein in a
highly specialized area of research. Despite her perseverance, she meets with failure after
failure. Finally, she goes to her PI, Dr. Smith, who is an internationally recognized investigator in
Jane’s area of research, and confesses her problem. The PI is silent for a while and then says,
“Don’t fret. I’ll have something for you to look at tomorrow.” The following day when Jane
arrives at the lab, she sees an unpublished manuscript on her desk with a post-it note from Dr.
Smith that says: “Jane, read the methods and results sections of this paper. I think they might
contain the solution to your problems. But don’t tell anybody I gave you this. As soon as you
are finished, return the paper to me. And don’t make any copies of it.” The paper describes an
experiment that seems exactly suited to solving Jane’s problem. Sure enough and within a few
days, Jane has purified the protein using the approach. She gleefully reports all this to her PI
and returns the paper. She can’t help asking though, “Dr. Smith, I have searched the literature
high and low to find a method to help me with my project and found absolutely nothing. Where
did you get that manuscript?” to which Dr. Smith obliquely replies, “Oh, I’ve got a ton of them.”
Discuss the ethical dimensions of this scenario.","We purposefully omitted describing the origins of the paper Jane read because therein lies the moral
content of this dilemma. The paper could have been written by Dr. Smith or a student in his lab and
never published. Or it could have been a paper that Dr. Smith was reviewing for a peer-reviewed
publication or for the NIH as a research grant application. Or it could have been a paper that had been
reviewed for publication, was accepted, and was awaiting publication in the very near future. With an
understanding of the federal Office of Research Integrity’s characterization of plagiarism as “the theft or
misappropriation of intellectual property and the substantial unattributed textual copying of another’s
work,” 2
 let’s consider each of these possibilities.
Scenario #1: The paper was written by a former student of Dr. Smith’s who was working in Dr. Smith’s
lab at the time. The paper was never published nor was it ever submitted for publication.
Under these circumstances, there shouldn’t be a problem with Jane’s having access to and
working from the paper’s methods and results section. The reason is that Dr. Smith’s university, which
we shall call Exemplary U, probably owns the student’s work as intellectual property.3
 The only way the
student could lay an unproblematic claim to owning the work is if he had already received the
University’s permission for him to copyright the material. If the student never sought copyright
authorization or sought to publish the paper, Dr. Smith—as the university’s representative and under
whose direction and auspices the work was performed—would seemingly have sufficient authority to
allow other investigators in his lab access to it.
As just implied, an interesting twist in this scenario would occur if the paper’s original author,
who let us suppose is now working at another university, would want to publish the paper’s methods or
propose their use in his own NIH application. This situation happens occasionally, as investigators will
work together in a lab on a given project and subsequently go their separate ways. They might think
that they can take their data and methods from their previous workplace without worry because, after 
all, they created them. But their belief about their owning that intellectual property would be quite
problematic without an antecedent contractual agreement with the university at which their work
originally occurred.3
As the original methodology, which we shall call “the work,” was created at Exemplary U, the
university owns it and might wish to exert its property interest in that work.3
 The student investigator
will doubtlessly have signed an employment agreement with Exemplary U acknowledging the latter’s
ownership of his labor. So, if the student, who is now working at another university, would publish that
paper as his own or if his current university would want to patent those methods (i.e., the ones that
Jane used), Exemplary U would have grounds to sue (at least for breach of contract and perhaps
copyright or patent infringement).
Consequently, this scenario doesn’t appear to represent any moral turpitude on Dr. Smith’s
part. Nevertheless, when it comes time for Jane to write up her experiment for publication, she most
certainly should acknowledge her predecessor’s work in supplying the methodology she used. Indeed, if
she decides she wants to cut and paste the wording that describes the methodology from the original
paper, she is ethically obligated to contact the original author and invite him as an author on the paper.
There is a sense in which the wording of the methodology section belongs to him, and Jane would be
plagiarizing if she simply usurped that language and claimed it as her own. (This would not be
essentially different from a situation where Jack and Jill are working in the same lab and Jill appropriates
a paragraph word-for-word from a paper Jack is writing and pastes it in her own manuscript as her own
work.)
So if Jane should wish to publish her work, she must first ask Dr. Smith for the name and contact
information of the student author. Dr. Smith would then be ethically obligated to supply this
information to Jane so that Jane can fulfill her ethical obligations. Indeed, given that Dr. Smith is the
senior researcher in this scenario, he should from the outset reveal to Jane the origin of the work and
inform Jane of her ethical obligations--and his willingness to supply the name and contact information--
should she wish to publish.
Scenario #2: The paper is one that Dr. Smith was recently asked to review for a peer-reviewed
publication or an NIH application. He hasn’t turned in his review yet.
In this scenario, Dr. Smith has certainly committed moral turpitude by sharing the paper with
Jane without permission. Journal reviewers and NIH reviewers pledge confidentiality, at least because
the review process would be entirely unworkable if scientists couldn’t trust reviewers to honor the
identity of the work’s originators or feared that reviewers might steal the paper’s ideas and methods! 4
Smith’s knowledge of this paper along with Jane’s distress presents him with a conflict of loyalty. On the
one hand, he is duty bound to respect his confidentiality agreement with the journal or the NIH. On the
other hand, he feels a duty to help Jane with her research.
But by sharing the work with Jane, he not only violates that confidentiality agreement in
principle, he shows very poor practical judgment in failing to consider how Jane (as well as himself
perhaps) might eventually use the knowledge that obviously isn’t theirs. The Office of Research Integrity
asserts that “The theft or misappropriation of intellectual property includes the unauthorized use of
ideas or unique methods obtained by a privileged communication, such as a grant or manuscript
review.”2
 Thus, suppose Jane and Dr. Smith eventually submit a paper to a peer-reviewed journal or an
application to the NIH that describes the methods they’ll use but that does not acknowledge the source
or the originator of those methods. Notice, once they put forward work to the scientific community—as
in a paper submission or a grant—that derived from another’s work but that they nevertheless and
without authorization represent as theirs, they have committed plagiarism for which they can be
sanctioned severely.
And, unfortunately, that does happen. Alan Price published a paper in 2006 that reviewed 19
plagiarism cases that came to the Federal Office of Research Integrity’s attention.1
Price related one
case involving a professor of pathology “who copied almost all of a grant application on human DNA
telomerase enzyme … which had been given to him in confidence by a peer reviewer. The respondent
(i.e., the pathology professor accused of plagiarism) used it in his own NIH grant application.” 1, p.3

Another rather bizarre case involved a professor of chemistry who was accused by a former colleague
of plagiarizing the latter’s research design ideas from an NIH grant application into his own application.
Upon being accused, the alleged plagiarizer claimed that he had given the application to a postdoctoral
fellow as an academic exercise, and he had not realized that the fellow had actually plagiarized some of
the words from the application, which the alleged plagiarizer then—unknowingly he claimed—
incorporated into his own grant application. When asked to identify the post doctoral student, whose
protection was promised by both ORI and the University, the alleged plagiarizer refused.1, p. 2

What would be comical if the situation wasn’t so unfortunate (and sometimes career-ending) is
how such plagiarists fail to appreciate how their plagiarized work might fall into the very hands of the
person(s) from whom the work was plagiarized! But only a moment’s consideration is needed to be
impressed with that likelihood. Consider Jane’s case. She is working on a highly specialized project to
which only a handful of investigators around the world are devoting substantial effort. She finally finds
the solution to her problem, which doubtless has been generated by just such a specialist. When she
herself submits the work for review without an attribution to the originator of her methods, there is a
high likelihood that that very specialist will be asked to review her work (or eventually come across it)
and that he or she will instantly recognize it as their own. Indeed, of the 19 cases that Price reviewed in
his paper, 8 of them dealt solely with plagiarism. (The other 11 dealt with plagiarism in combination
with falsification or fabrication.) Price wrote that:
All but 1 of these 8 ORI cases of solely plagiarism involved the copying of words and/or ideas in
NIH grant applications, detected by a reviewer, who was in most cases the original applicant
whose own grant application to NIH (or to NSF), or the original author whose own publication,
had been plagiarized; they just happened to become a reviewer for NIH or NSF of the
questioned application and then reported the plagiarism to agency officials.1, p. 4
So, a point in this scenario is that while it is a serious lapse of professional integrity to breach a
confidentiality agreement and allow an unauthorized individual access to another’s confidentially
protected work, going the additional, morally unspeakable step of stealing that work and trying to pass
it off as one’s own might be easily discovered. Doing so combines theft with misrepresentation and can
blemish one’s career in a way from which he or she might never recover.
Scenario #3: The paper has been accepted for publication and will appear soon.
So, here, one might think that the moral thing for Dr. Smith to do would be to contact the author of the
paper and ask for permission to share the paper with Jane and allow her to replicate the experiment.
Once the author grants permission, then all things should proceed smoothly. If the author refuses, then
Jane must wait until the paper appears in print.
In fact, though, Dr. Smith needs to contact the journal editors first and secure their permission
for him to contact the author at least because 1) the journal owns the copyright to the material and
might wish to control its dissemination before it appears in wide circulation, and 2) the journal might
wish to keep Dr. Smith’s identity, as a reviewer, unknown to the author (and so refuse Dr. Smith’s
request). 4

Generally, if the journal has no problem with a request like Dr. Smith’s, an editor will contact the
author and inquire if he or she would entertain a request like Smith’s. The author might approve but
with stipulations—such that the paper can be read and discussed by members of a particular lab but not
disseminated to anyone else; or the author might stipulate that the paper can be read and discussed but 
none of the novel research methods described in the paper can be tried by anyone until the paper is
published. Or the author might deny the request altogether—perhaps because his institution wishes to
patent some of the paper’s intellectual work and the patent application process is taking longer than
expected. Interestingly, an author might be able to publish a paper and then patent its ideas later, but
doing so is tricky. Shamoo and Resnik note that:
If investors publish their ideas (or someone else does) prior to filing a patent, this may prevent
them from obtaining a patent on their inventions in most countries. However, the U.S. patent
laws have a one-year grace period from publication to patent. Thus, in the United States,
investors can publish first and patent later. However, they may submit a provisional patent
application with the U.S. Patent and Trade Office when they submit for publication, to protect
their proprietary interest before filing a patent. 3, p. 126
In conclusion, the temptation to use another scientist’s work product might be considerable and, based
on past history, certain persons will succumb to that temptation. The typical penalties handed down by
the NIH for plagiarism include the plagiarist’s having to certify through an institutional official that his or
her future grant applications and reports cite all sources appropriately; and/or the ORI can prohibit
plagiarists from serving on Public Health Service advisory committees, such as grant study sections for a
period of time (e.g., 2 to 10 years); or the plagiarist can be barred from receiving grants for a specific
period.1

One cannot fail to be impressed by how today’s investigators must not only be technically
scrupulous in their labs, but morally scrupulous as well. By sharing the manuscript with Jane, Dr. Smith
might be doing something morally unproblematic or he might be inviting disaster into his and Jane’s
careers. The devil is often in the details, but it will be the details or the circumstances of cases like these
that inform their moral status. ","%Introduction:
This case presents a complex ethical dilemma involving the sharing of unpublished research methods, raising questions about intellectual property rights, confidentiality, and professional integrity in academic research.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The origin of the manuscript is crucial to determining the ethical implications. Three key scenarios emerge: it could be an unpublished paper from Dr. Smith's lab, a manuscript under peer review, or an accepted but unpublished paper. Each scenario carries different ethical obligations and potential consequences.

The power dynamics between student and advisor, confidentiality agreements in peer review, and proper attribution of research methods are also critical considerations.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The Office of Research Integrity defines plagiarism as ""the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property and substantial unattributed textual copying."" This framework, along with established practices in academic publishing and peer review, guides the ethical analysis of such situations.

Historical cases documented by Alan Price demonstrate that unauthorized use of confidential research methods often leads to discovery and serious professional consequences.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
For unpublished lab work, proper attribution and permission from original authors should be secured. For papers under review, maintaining confidentiality is paramount. For accepted papers, formal permission should be obtained through proper channels, including journal editors and authors.

Clear communication about the origin of methods and appropriate attribution in future publications is essential.

%Key Takeaways:
The ethical handling of unpublished research methods requires careful consideration of ownership, confidentiality, and proper attribution. Professional integrity in academic research extends beyond technical accuracy to include moral obligations regarding the use and sharing of intellectual property.

Breaching these ethical standards can have severe consequences for academic careers, highlighting the importance of following proper protocols when sharing research methods.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This ethical dilemma revolves around the sharing of unpublished research material by a principal investigator (PI) with a graduate student, raising questions about intellectual property, confidentiality, and the ethical obligations of both parties in a research setting.', 'Key Factors': 'Key factors include the ownership of intellectual property, the ethical implications of sharing unpublished work, the potential for plagiarism, and the responsibilities of researchers to maintain confidentiality and integrity in their work.', 'Historical & Theoretical Perspectives': ""The scenario highlights the complexities of intellectual property rights in academia, referencing the Office of Research Integrity's definition of plagiarism.

This scenario highlights ethical concerns surrounding academic integrity, mentorship, and the responsible sharing of unpublished research. Jane’s PI, Dr. Smith, provides her with an unpublished manuscript containing a solution to her research problem but instructs her to keep it confidential, raising questions about transparency and fairness in scientific collaboration.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key ethical factors include the unauthorized use of unpublished work, the potential breach of trust between collaborators, and the implications for Jane’s academic development. The secrecy surrounding the manuscript suggests it may belong to another researcher, which could violate norms of intellectual property and proper attribution. Additionally, Jane’s reliance on undisclosed methods undermines the reproducibility and credibility of her work.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, scientific progress relies on open communication and peer review. Theories like Merton’s norms of science emphasize communalism (shared knowledge) and organized skepticism. The scenario contrasts with these ideals, as the manuscript’s origins are obscured, potentially violating ethical guidelines for research transparency and collaboration.  

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
Dr. Smith should clarify the manuscript’s origins and seek permission from its authors before sharing it. Jane could advocate for ethical transparency by discussing her concerns with the PI or an institutional ethics committee. Alternatively, the lab could establish clear protocols for handling unpublished data to prevent similar dilemmas.

This case presents serious ethical violations in medical research involving vulnerable populations, specifically concerning informed consent, conflict of interest, and research integrity.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The primary ethical concerns include Dr. Smith's dual role as facility owner and researcher, improper consent procedures with dementia patients, misuse of power of attorney, data falsification, and attempted coercion of staff. The vulnerability of the research subjects and the breach of research ethics protocols are particularly troubling.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
This case echoes historical research ethics violations like the Tuskegee experiments, where vulnerable populations were exploited. It demonstrates why the Belmont Report principles (respect for persons, beneficence, and justice) and subsequent research regulations were established to protect vulnerable populations and ensure proper informed consent.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The appropriate response would be to report these violations to relevant authorities, including the Institutional Review Board (IRB), state medical board, and possibly adult protective services. Documentation of all questionable practices should be maintained, and staff should be protected under whistleblower provisions.

8,"I had decided to submit my first abstract ever for a neuroscience conference that I very much
wanted to attend. My research consisted of running human subjects through an fMRI scan so
as to collect brain activation data in response to simple visual stimuli. My data and analyses
appeared solid as the time drew near for me to write the abstract, so I was excited and eager to
proceed. My postdoc slowed me down, however, with a suggestion that I include a few more
subjects in the study. I agreed but voiced a concern that the submission deadline was coming
up. “Maybe you can use yourself in your study,” he said. “I mean, it’s only an abstract that
you’re submitting, and you can recruit more subjects between now and the conference and
make corrections accordingly.”
I was uneasy about using myself as a subject. I felt it was somehow unethical even
though I knew there was no way I could bias the results of the study due to the simplicity of the
paradigm I was using. Luckily, I was spared the problem: The next day my postdoc recruited
some subjects for the study so I avoided having to use myself. However, I still wonder what
would have happened if new subjects were not recruited. It was such a simple experiment that
I couldn’t have affected the results. But would recruiting myself be considered a conflict of
interest or be somehow unethical? ","In reflecting on this scenario, we were reminded of Hans Jonas’s famous essay “Philosophical
Reflections on Experimenting with Human Subjects,” which was originally published in 1969
and represented one of the early attempts to perform bioethical analysis from a secular rather
than religious or theological perspective.
According to that essay, Jonas would very much approve of our young investigator’s
self-recruitment. Jonas asserted that investigators themselves are ideal research participants
because:
If it is full, autonomous identification of the subject with the purpose that is required for
the dignifying of his serving as a subject—here it is; if strongest motivation—here it is; if
fullest understanding—here it is; if freest decision—here it is; if greatest integration
with the person’s total, chosen pursuit—here it is…By himself the scientist is free to
obey his obsession, to play his hunch, to wager on chance, to follow the lure of
ambition. It is all part of the “divine madness” that somehow animates the ceaseless
pressing against frontiers.
So, Jonas is arguing that nonmanipulation, motivation, and acute understanding of and
identification with the research goals are best exhibited by the investigators themselves.
Furthermore, if we worry about whether an individual’s participation in research is justified
given the risks, then the investigator’s passion and commitment to scientific discovery should
remove that anxiety and recommend his or her qualifications for participation in the strongest
terms possible. 
Complimenting Jonas’s argument, the history of scientific discovery is replete with
instances where investigators recruited themselves in their experiments. Perhaps the most
remarkable example is Barry Marshall, an Australian gastroenterologist who proved that most
stomach ulcers are caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori by drinking a solution that
contained the microbe in 1982.
 He and his colleague Robin Warren shared the Nobel Prize for
Medicine in 2005 in recognition of their discovery. After successful inoculation with monkeys,
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine on himself, his wife and his children. Werner Forssman was
awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in medicine for his work on heart catheterization. He inserted a
catheter into his vein until it reached the right atrium of his heart and then took an X-ray of the
placement to prove it could work. Kevin Warwick, a British robotics researcher, implanted
electrodes in his body (and later in his wife’s) that could send signals to a robotic arm. His
discovery that impulses could be sent from the human nervous system to an artificial one
spurred the “transhumanist” movement, which is interested in the ethical use of electronic
augmentation or enhancement of the natural human body.
Unfortunately, not all such self-recruitment in scientific history ended as well as these.
In the early nineteenth century, Humphry Davy and Horace Wells became addicted to nitrous
oxide and chloroform respectively, as they investigated their anesthesiological properties.
(Davy’s chronic use incapacitated him for the last 20 years of his life, while Wells committed
suicide.)
 Daniel Alcides Carrion died in 1885 at the age of 28 when he had a friend inject him
with blood drawn from the wart of a 14-year old suffering from what was then called Oroya
fever. Carrion developed the disease and died. In his honor, Oroya fever—which was at
epidemic levels in Peru when Carrion studied it—was renamed Carrion Disease and the
Peruvian government recognizes October 5, the day of Carrion’s death, as Peruvian Medicine
Day.
And then there are Elizabeth Ascheim Woolf, Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin who all
died of radiation exposure from their use of X-ray technology. Ascheim and her husband set up
for the first X-ray laboratory in San Francisco and experimented with the technology unaware
of its dangers.
Rosalind Franklin would surely have shared the Nobel Prize with Watson, Crick
and Wilkins in 1962 for the discovery of DNA. But Franklin died from ovarian cancer in 1958,
almost certainly as a result of her using X-ray crystallography to decipher the B form of the
helical structure of the DNA molecule.
Per the above scenario and pace Hans Jonas, contemporary ethics would probably
recommend a very conservative course as to whether or not an investigator should recruit him
or herself for an experiment. One fear is that if the investigator doesn’t suffer from the disease
being studied, he or she may feel a need to acquire it in order to test his or her hypothesis, as
Barry Marshall did. But an investigator’s intentionally introducing a disease into his or her body
can be strikingly antithetical to the utilitarian goal of achieving net utility. If the investigator
takes significant risks with his or her welfare, the promise of the research deliverable, i.e., the
end for which these efforts are being sought, is frankly imperiled. Had Jonas Salk’s injection of
the polio vaccine resulted in his being permanently incapacitated from the disease (or from
something related), the world would have to await another discoverer, which could have taken
years. One is reminded of the airline safety precaution to parents traveling with family if
oxygen in the cabin is discontinued: When the safety masks drop down, first place one on 
yourself and then help others. Inordinate altruism may result in a self-sacrifice that can
ultimately produce a significant net disutility.
Arguing from a deontological perspective, research participants largely serve as a means
to the end of hypothesis confirmation or the aggregation of beneficial, generalizable
knowledge. Nevertheless, we try to treat research participants as ends in themselves both
through the informed consent process as well as insisting on IRB protections, such that
participants are not subjected to more than minimal risk (save in exceptional cases that might
favorably and directly impact their welfare). Consequently, the investigator who first enrolls
himself in his own trial—which is a trial of 1, of course—before going through an IRB approval
process can be assuming too much risk and should be protected from his or her risky behavior.
Furthermore, and contrary to Jonas’s assertion that the investigator is the one best able
to give informed consent, one might argue that some researchers are so blinded by ambition or
the opportunity for prestige that they are unable to offer a truly voluntary and thoughtful
consent to participation in an experiment where the risks might be unreasonably high.
Of course and from a purely methodological perspective, an N of 1 is just that: a single
data point that can hardly count as generalizable knowledge. While some might find Salk’s
injecting himself with the polio vaccine admirable—less so, his injecting his wife and especially
less so his children—all it would have confirmed is that it was safe for him and his family but
possibly not safe for the family next door.
In the above scenario, however, safety does not appear to be a significant concern as
indicated by the millions of persons who have had MRIs without incident. We worry instead
about our young investigator’s participation from another angle: Might the findings on his
brain function be skewed by his familiarity with the research and its purpose?
On the one hand, if the investigator’s research goal is purely descriptive, i.e, motivated
by an interest in discerning the neural activation patterns of a particular visual stimulus such
that nothing beyond that descriptive aim is desired, then his participation is probably
acceptable. On the other hand, if a research hypothesis has been forwarded, e.g., “visual
stimuli of this or that sort will activate brain regions X, Y and Z,” then it might be the case that
the investigator’s foreknowledge of that hypothesis can bias his neural responses to the stimuli
in favor of the hypothesis.
This argument is hardly idle. Commentators discussing the substitution of fMRI for
polygraphy in lie detection have commented that the current state of the technology in no way
argues for such (assuming it even argues for the merits of polygraphy). Just as individuals have
learned to fool polygraphy, e.g., by biting their tongues or pressing their toes to the floor, they
might just as well fool an MRI by concentrating on feelings, thoughts or images that, with
enough know-how on their part, might produce findings that “prove” their testimony.
Consequently, it appears that we should be very cautious, even hesitant, about the idea
of researchers recruiting themselves for experiments. If the research posed minimal risks and
there is no compelling reason to think that the investigator could skew or bias his or her test
results in the direction of some research hypothesis, then his or her participation is probably
acceptable. If, however, the risks are considerable and/or a biased result from the
investigator’s participation is indeed possible, then that researcher’s participation would be
morally problematic and so should be disallowed. Ultimately, a researcher who enrolls him or
herself in an experiment before any other subjects are enrolled and especially before a 
sufficient amount of data collection among animals has occurred is acting rashly and is not
furthering the cause of science. 


","%Introduction:
This dilemma addresses the ethical implications of researchers participating as subjects in their own studies, specifically in the context of fMRI research, raising questions about scientific integrity and potential bias.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The main considerations include minimal risk level of fMRI procedures, potential for bias due to researcher's knowledge of the study, methodological validity of self-recruitment, and the urgency of meeting submission deadlines. The simplicity of the experimental paradigm and the researcher's inability to consciously influence results are also relevant factors.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
Hans Jonas's philosophical perspective advocated for researcher self-experimentation, viewing investigators as ideal participants due to their complete understanding and motivation. Historical examples range from successful cases like Barry Marshall's H. pylori discovery to tragic outcomes like Marie Curie's radiation exposure, demonstrating both the potential benefits and risks of self-experimentation.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The recommended approach is to exercise caution with self-recruitment, permitting it only when two conditions are met: the research poses minimal risk, and there is no reasonable possibility of the investigator biasing the results. Any self-experimentation should occur only after proper animal studies and IRB approval where applicable.

%Key Takeaways:
While self-experimentation has played a significant role in scientific discovery, modern ethical standards generally recommend against it except in cases of minimal risk and where bias is impossible. The focus should be on proper experimental design and participant recruitment rather than using oneself as a subject out of convenience or necessity.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma raises ethical questions about self-recruitment in research, particularly regarding the potential for bias and the implications of using oneself as a subject in scientific studies.', 'Key Factors': 'Key factors include the risk of bias in results due to foreknowledge of the research hypothesis, the ethical implications of self-recruitment, and the balance between personal motivation and the integrity of scientific inquiry.', 'Historical & Theoretical Perspectives': 'Hans Jonas’s reflections on experimenting with human subjects highlight the complexities of self-recruitment, while historical examples illustrate both successful and detrimental outcomes of such practices.

9,"One of the oddest but most memorable experiences I ever had in my graduate and postgraduate training occurred one morning when I got to the lab rather early. Our lab was
a large one, and had recruited a number of fine, junior investigators from Southeast
Asia. As I hung up my coat, I glanced into an adjacent room and saw three of them
apparently praying over their experimental materials. They were standing around their
lab table. Their eyes were tightly shut, and they were obviously chanting a prayer, all
the while making circular arm movements with their palms outstretched over the
experiment. I quickly moved away, and I don’t think they saw me.
This may sound crazy but is that ethical? I mean, can you ethically argue that
researchers should not pray over their experiments because such activity might
heighten their interpretational biases or—and this is where things really get vague—
introduce some kind of “contaminating variable” into the experiment? I mean, there
have been research studies on the power of prayer in medicine with some studies
actually showing positive results.
I’ll never forget this provocative and rather touching experience. It posed such a
contrast, or maybe I should say a confluence, between deeply felt and applied
spirituality with the objective, scientific mindset of Western research. But should the
lab director condone this sort of thing as a regular practice? Do you think it poses any
cause for ethical or professional concern?","This scenario speaks to lab management issues in terms of personnel behaviors
affecting the work atmosphere, as well as to metaphysical issues that involve Western
notions of scientific realism, causality, and objectivity.
Why might many Western investigators feel uncomfortable about this scenario?
Paradoxically, if the traditional paradigm of Western science would categorically dismiss
the possibility of divine intervention affecting a lab experiment, then why shouldn’t we
simply allow the lab personnel to pray as they wish and leave them alone? On the other
hand, one might argue that the opportunity for a Hawthorne-like effect is present as the
lab personnel might improve the quality of their work with the adoption of some formal,
group prayer practice.
So, one response to the scenario might be that if such ritualistic
praying is allowed and it occurs, it should be duly documented in the laboratory
notebooks, described in any reports or manuscript submissions, and maintained in all
significant experimental moments (e.g., praying over the control as well as the
experimental arms of a project) since some might understand it as a significant
experimental variable.
Perhaps an equally concerning issue is whether or not the practice of group
prayer in the laboratory disturbs the objectivity of the praying investigators. Does it so
heighten or reinforce their expectation of or desire for a specific experimental result
that their objectivity might be compromised, such that they might be more subjectively
inclined to claim the confirmation of their hypothesis when others would disagree?
Might the prayerful have their objectivity disturbed as, for example, believing that their
data and their interpretation of the data are divinely blessed? Or might the prayerful be
requesting a divine favor such that their team be blessed in being the first in making the
great discovery, which certainly sounds like self-interested praying? But many, if not all,
investigators aim and hope for and perhaps even sometimes pray for a particular result.
The question of blemished or corrupted objectivity is probably best managed in the
traditional way: by reasonable oversight or peer review in the lab, such that solid
hypotheses are framed, and researchers discuss and justify their data gathering and
findings with their peers.
Should we be troubled by the prayerful investigators invoking some kind of
metaphysical intercession? Don’t clinicians occasionally pray with their patients,
especially the ones about to undergo surgeries and the like? We recently heard a story
about hospital staff who prepare the packages of surgical tools that are to be used in
their hospital’s operating rooms.
The names of patients are printed on the orders, and
some of the staff remarked that as they fill the order, they quietly say a prayer for each
and every patient’s recovery. Remarkably, one staff member admitted to performing
this prayer practice for over forty years.
Why does a story like this seem so heart-warming, while praying over a lab
experiment seems problematic? The answer is that clinical interventions do not
primarily involve a search for truth but seek to accommodate the self-interests of
patients (by way of relieving their suffering, curing their ills or diseases, etc.).
The practice of medicine would not exist without self-interested consumers, and it is
precisely those self-interests that medicine seeks to accommodate whenever possible.
The practice of research, however, is primarily and fundamentally motivated by an
interest in uncovering the truth. Its practice is fundamentally epistemological: to
confirm a hypothesis or create generalizable knowledge. Of course, that knowledge
might ultimately advance another’s self-interests, such as the patient who ultimately
benefits from a new, FDA approved antibiotic or antidepressant. But the anticipation of
relief from suffering and royalties to the drug’s discoverers must occupy a second place
to the investigator’s primary moral obligations of protecting research participants from
unnecessary or unreasonable harm and taking pains to insure the integrity of his or her
data.
How, then, might this phenomenon be managed? First of all, if a lab director
forbade such a practice, would he or she be infringing on the prayers’ freedom of
religious expression? Must the lab director make a “reasonable accommodation” for the
prayers, such as allowing them to pray in the very early morning? Probably not. Because
praying over an experiment is not a traditional or customary expression of religious
worship, one could assert that it is not a reasonable accommodation issue. It is hard to
imagine the prayers persuasively arguing that the only place they can pray is in a
laboratory, while it is easy to imagine that certain personnel praying in a laboratory
might significantly disturb the lab’s psychological or work atmosphere.
On the other hand, and especially depending on whether the laboratory is
located in a state or religiously affiliated institution, might other lab personnel not only
not be disturbed by the practice, but welcome it? If so, the lab director might want to
discern how the prayer practice is being perceived by other staff. How do they
understand the practice’s effect on the research being conducted and, especially, on
reporting experimental results? How does it affect other work being done? The lab
director must carefully ask him or herself “What exactly ought I be responding to here?”
(and, even then, be very thoughtful about how his or her own biases might affect the
answers).
Should the institution develop a policy on this? Does it matter, for example,
whether the experiment is federally or privately funded? Should these questions be
clarified by the institution’s office of legal affairs? Would it be acceptable for the
institution to leave the matter entirely up to the discretion of any of its lab directors,
such that they could categorically forbid the practice, or only allow it before or after the
lab’s customary hours of operation, or allow prayer to be practiced at any time?
Ultimately, this scenario recalls Horst Rittel’s and Melvin Webber’s 1973
discussion of the “wicked problem.”
Wicked problems are invariably multifactorial;
their very articulation is problematic as different persons will disagree on what the true
or real problem is; suggestions at resolving the problem only generate more problems;
no resolution seems more than tentative; and the core of the problem appears to
involve vague, ever-changing, or inconsistent phenomena.
There appears to be no decisive resolution to this scenario as different persons
will understand and weigh the questions and issues articulated above differently. The
idea of a ritual prayer practice over an experiment seems to challenge if not contradict
Western comprehensions of scientific method, but there is no way to prevent entirely
those who insist on its practice. The challenge is to evolve a management strategy in
the lab that is fair and respectful to the prayers, that respects the sensibilities of others,
and that does not compromise the integrity of research findings.

This dilemma explores the intersection of spirituality and scientific research, questioning whether prayer in a lab setting introduces ethical or methodological concerns. It highlights the tension between personal beliefs and the objective norms of Western science.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the potential for bias in experimental interpretation, the cultural and personal significance of prayer to the researchers, and the broader implications for scientific rigor. The dilemma also raises questions about inclusivity and respect for diverse practices in collaborative environments.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, the relationship between science and spirituality has been contentious, with debates ranging from the Galileo affair to modern studies on prayer’s efficacy. Theoretical perspectives like positivism emphasize objectivity, while postmodern critiques acknowledge the role of subjectivity in research. The placebo effect and observer bias are also relevant concepts.  

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
One approach is to foster open dialogue within the lab, ensuring that spiritual practices do not interfere with methodological transparency. Lab directors could establish guidelines that respect cultural practices while maintaining scientific integrity, such as documenting any non-standard procedures to assess their impact.

10,"I was finishing my senior year in college—a small mid-Western, liberal arts college—and was working in
Dr. Smith’s lab. Now, this college did not receive many grants, but Dr. Smith was recognized throughout
the school (and frankly envied by a lot of his colleagues) as a real rainmaker. Despite the rather humble
resources of the college, Smith was always getting money to run and grow his lab, and he turned out a
number of students over the years who went on to have significant careers in science.
I was doing some extra-credit work in his lab, frankly hoping to be able to add material to my
resume as I was applying to veterinary school. I was finishing a preliminary project and had gotten some
very preliminary, but very interesting data. With graduation looming, however, I was discouraged that I
couldn’t replicate them. Naturally, I reported this to Dr. Smith, and we worked on it some. But to no
avail: we simply could not replicate the original findings.
I then had to write a final report on this project which we would send to the funding agency for
grant continuation. I duly noted the nature of the experiments, the preliminary data, and the fact that
repeated attempts to replicate the data failed. I turned the report into Dr. Smith, but when he gave me
the final copy that he was sending to the funding agency, I noticed that he had deleted the sentences
about the data replication failures.
I asked him why, and he said that it was abundantly clear in the report that this data was very
preliminary and was not at all being described as definitive. Second, he remarked that my project was
one of three others that he was reporting on, and that these projects were much farther along and more
important to the grantor. He felt that my findings were relatively insignificant in comparison to the
others so there wasn’t any point in belaboring my current failure to replicate my results. Third, he
pointed out that it might still be possible to replicate the data. He speculated that perhaps my samples
had gotten contaminated and that if we had a few more months to work on it, we’d confirm my original
results.
And that was it. I graduated and moved on. But Dr. Smith’s omitting mention of my replication
failures has always stuck in my memory. Was it wrong or was he justified? ","So, the dilemma contributor tells us that she got some interesting, but very preliminary data per an
experiment she was performing. She then, after repeated attempts, utterly failed to replicate the
original findings. In editing the dilemma contributor’s final report, Dr. Smith—the dilemma contributor’s
advisor and lab supervisor—deletes mention of the replication failures and only mentions the positive
findings. When questioned, Dr. Smith offers three reasons:
1) The experimental data are very preliminary, so they might be confirmed or disconfirmed at
some future time. In Smith’s mind, this preliminarity morally justifies the selective omission of
the replication failures in the report.
2) Because other projects in the lab are farther along, the focus of the report must be on them.
This seems to justify a brief, but nevertheless positive mention of the original findings without a
need to belabor the details of the replication failures.
3) Perhaps the replication failures are the result of contamination of the student’s samples,
such that the original findings will ultimately turn out to be true.
This case scenario is an interesting one as it invites a discussion of the important phenomenon of
“motivated reasoning.”
Motivated reasoning has attracted scholarly attention for nearly twenty years and draws on
even older theories, especially dissonance and attribution theory.
 Taken together, the core premises of motivated reasoning are that people usually will be 1) motivated to reduce the unpleasantness of  conflicting or dissonant beliefs, by 2) evaluating such dissonant information on the basis of how well it coincides with their own deeply held values, or about issues in which they have a serious, personal stake, or according to their self-understanding as worthwhile, competent, adequate, decent human beings.
 In a word, motivated reasoning holds that individuals will predictably reach conclusions that
nicely corroborate or are synchronous with the beliefs and values they already hold very dear and which
often sustain or are significant aspects of their self-identity.
Consequently, when it comes to cognitive materials that strike at issues about which we have
strong, antecedently formed notions, we will “reason” in reverse. Consciously or unconsciously, one
“knows” the conclusion one wants to reach before the data are presented. As that data are being
presented, he or she rather automatically rejects, (re)arranges, saliences, “massages,” or simply ignores
certain ones such that the conclusion that is secured is the one that he or she prefers.
One does not have to be a moral psychologist to grant the persuasiveness of motivated
reasoning theory. What kind of “objective evidence” would it take to turn a die-hard liberal like Teddy
Kennedy into a die-hard conservative like Rush Limbaugh and vice versa? What would it take to turn a
rabid anti-abortionist into a staunch supporter of a woman’s right to choose? What kind of evidence
would be required to persuade the Pope that God doesn’t exist or turn a staunch gun-control advocate
into a card carrying member of the NRA? The motivated reasoning theorist would say that virtually any
intellectual effort at ideological conversion in these cases will fail. Each individual would hold onto his
beliefs unshakably and not be deterred by even the most factually compelling, logically powerful
arguments the other side offers. Each would counterargue by ignoring evidence contrary to his cause or
reinterpret or rewrite that evidence such that it fits his or her ideology. As noted above, the motivated
reasoner already knows the conclusion he or she will reach. One simply selectively chooses and
arranges the premises, reasons, or evidence to infer it.
And so we return to Dr. Smith. He is the school’s rainmaker and has turned out a large number
of students over the years who have gone on to have significant careers in science. Doubtlessly, he
holds himself, his lab, and his lab’s deliverables in high esteem (or, at least, he is anxious about
maintaining that public reputation). To him, the public admission of repeated failures to replicate
certain initially interesting, provocative findings is very distasteful and implies defeat. It doesn’t
comport with his vision of his lab’s deliverables and, of course, he needs no reminding of the apparent
bias in scientific publications for positive findings.
 Not surprisingly, the reasons he gives above are
motivated to provide just the conclusion he wants: omit mentioning the replication failures. So let us
review Dr. Smith’s (motivated) reasoning.
If, as the first reason suggests, the data are very preliminary, then it is hard to understand why
that preliminarity somehow favors publishing the positive results but doesn’t equally apply to
acknowledging the replication failures. If one is going to only publish half the data, why favor the
positive half? Indeed, given the repeated but failed attempts to replicate the positive findings, one
might argue that the negative data are less preliminary and more robust than the positive findings.
The second argument—that because other projects are much farther along, we won’t dwell on
yours—is odd: “We will just briefly highlight the positive findings of your preliminary experiment, and
then quickly move on to the more serious material.” This thinking attempts to shift attention away from
the distress of considering the replication failures and one’s moral obligation to present them. It is an
excellent example of motivated reasoning by way of causing an attentional shift from unpleasant
considerations to things that are much more comfortable to ponder.
The third argument—that if we had more time, we might be able to replicate those positive
findings after all—is wishful thinking masquerading as rational argument. If there is no current evidence
that the experimental samples are contaminated, why give that speculation so much credibility? The
answer is because the speculation corroborates the desired or preferred course of action, which is to
note the positive findings and omit mention of the replication failures.
Believing as true only the data I want to is antithetical to science. While the above scenario is
only a report to a funding agency for grant continuation, one might argue that the purposeful deletion
of relevant material is just as ethically indefensible as submitting massaged, incomplete, or otherwise
untruthful data for publication. With grant money increasingly insufficient to fund the growing number
of competitive, highly ranked proposals, deceit in a grant continuation report (or an application that
cites previous work) can have downstream consequences just as damaging to the advancement of
science as a faulty publication.
Sooner or later, of course, replicability is supposed to win out. In the meantime, partial data
reporting only slows down the scientific engine and can create a great deal of needless effort among
other scientists. Further and as noted in other expert opinions on this website, the publication of
negative findings can sometimes be much more valuable than publishing positive ones. Perhaps the
scientific community will support stricter requirements for posting negative lab and trial results, and
penalties for failure to do so. Registering clinical trials, where all data must be reported, is certainly a
step in the right direction.
 Dr. Smith should have appreciated all this more. He should have had his
student publish both the positive and negative findings; have her speculate on reasons for the
replication failures; and not have presented her with an instance of motivated reasoning. 


","%Introduction:
This case presents an ethical dilemma involving selective reporting of scientific data, where a professor omits negative replication results from a grant continuation report, raising questions about scientific integrity and transparency.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The main factors include the preliminary nature of the data, the context of grant funding pressures, the professor's reputation as a successful grant recipient, and the balance between positive and negative findings. The relative importance of the project compared to others in the lab and the potential for future replication also play roles in the decision-making process.

11,"My PI and I were working on an experiment to see if Y occurred when a particular gene was
knocked out. If Y did indeed occur, we would be keen to publish the finding. Determining
whether or not Y occurred would require our doing some assays.
The problem was that assay #1 confirmed Y, but assay #2 disconfirmed Y. It must be
noted that these were not duplicate assays but completely different ones. And repeated assays
of both types kept giving us the same contradictory findings.
So, the first issue was the temptation to simply tell my PI of the preferred result, namely
the one that confirmed Y. I told myself this wouldn’t be a lie, but it came close. So, I told the PI
about both assays. At this point we were confronted with the following decisions: Should we
publish (and therefore believe) the results from the assay that worked and disregard the “bad”
one, assuming that the problem involved some flaw in that assay? Or should we mention in the
publication that we were only able to show Y with one assay, and not with another? Or should
we try a third assay and go with it (as a tie-breaker)?
We went with the last strategy which fortunately confirmed Y and justified our paper.
But suppose there wasn’t a third assay available? What then? ","The literature calls the kind of temptation the dilemma contributor describes an instance of
“selective reporting.”
 Although not exactly a manipulation of data, selective reporting is more
a kind of “editing” one’s findings such that the data that are reported put those findings in the
best possible light. While the above case concerns the temptation to withhold disconfirming
test results, other instances of selective reporting might involve deleting data points,
succumbing to pressures by a commercial research sponsor to report on only one aspect of a
study (e.g., superior outcomes rather than worrisome adverse events), using percentages rather
than actual numbers (so as to omit mentioning that the actual sample size was very small),
applying multiple statistical tests to the same data set but only reporting the test(s) that yield
the most favorable results, and ignoring mention of prior research that challenge the stated
findings.
One cannot help but recall the Vioxx scandal, which began with the publication of the
VIGOR study in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2000.
The authors of that
study omitted their finding that Vioxx carried a five-times higher risk for myocardial infarction,
thrombo-embolic events, hypertension and heart failure than the comparator, naproxen.
 By
the time the VIGOR study appeared, however, the FDA had already approved Vioxx despite
knowing about the elevated cardiovascular risks. (Apparently, the FDA accepted the
investigators’ rather remarkable explanation that Vioxx’s apparent risks were actually due to “a
potential cardioprotective effect of the comparator drug.”) By 2002, however, the FDA
had received enough reports of adverse cardiovascular events associated with Vioxx to prompt
requiring Vioxx’s manufacturer, Merck Sharpe & Dohme, to list those risks in Vioxx’s package
insert. By 2004, when the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention On Vioxx) study appeared
and confirmed Vioxx’s dangerous risk profile, Merck voluntarily withdrew the drug worldwide.
Our reason for recalling the Vioxx case is that its lessons speak directly to the above
case: The reporting of research or clinical results must contemplate other investigators or
clinicians repeating those experiments or interventions. Investigators who simply want to
publish findings that support their hypotheses suffer from a kind of professional or ethical
myopia. Did the Vioxx investigators really think that the drug’s side effect profile would go 
unnoticed ad infinitum? If they believed their research was competently performed, did they
think that Vioxx’s consumers wouldn’t begin demonstrating precisely the kinds of cardiovascular
symptoms that the study participants did? Vioxx is perhaps an extreme case, but that’s why it’s
worth remembering. The consequences of selective reporting can be catastrophic: Consumers
profoundly harmed, professional careers trashed, the public’s trust in science seriously eroded,
and extremely costly litigation waiting in the wings.
Specific to the case above, bench scientists would likely assert that one ought never rely
on only one experimental approach.
 Indeed, very rarely is any one assay result definitive.
Because it can be maddeningly difficult to control for all the variables that can affect a result or
a finding, one generally wants to test one’s hypothesis in as many ways as one can. The
research team that selectively reports data from a single assay will likely arouse the suspicions
of any competent reviewer, who will wonder why other assays weren’t performed.
This will especially be the case if the investigator’s experimental question has a
significant history. That history will probably frame or suggest the number and kinds of assays
the scientific community will expect to be reported, enumerate the variables to be controlled,
describe the potential for misinterpreting findings (e.g., sometimes an experiment succeeds but
not necessarily for the reasons the investigators posit) and suggest which data to believe, which
to doubt, and which to report.
Nevertheless, there can be considerable value in reporting results that are inconsistent
as well as consistent with the hypothesis. In the above scenario, if a third assay wasn’t possible,
the investigators would have done well by their colleagues to have reported the results of both
assays. That way their peers will have a truthful and complete rendering of the experiment and
its results, whereas a partial or selective presentation of data slows the engine of science: Other
researchers will have to discover the partiality of the data, call professional attention to it, and
fill in the gaps—all of which can take a great deal of time. (This is one reason why reporting
negative data can be so valuable, and why investigators often lament the apparent journalistic
bias against it.)
Investigators who encounter disconfirming as well as confirming data might greatly
benefit from peer advice and recommendations on how to present such findings. One question
to ask, for example, is whether or not there is historical precedent for the discrepant assay
results and what the explanation might be. We are not told in the scenario what kinds of assays
are being carried out, e.g., in vivo or in vitro; nor can we identify certain experimental conditions
that might account for discrepancies, e.g., temperature, the use of a particular dye or stain, etc.;
nor are we told about the finding of interest, e.g., a cellular structure or a behavior. Of course, it
might be the case that the reason for the negative or disconfirming result is a faulty design or
errors in the assay. Unlike clinical lab determinations that are done thousands of times and, one
hopes, have reasonably good of quality control, this is often not feasible for most research lab
determinations.
In any event, because assays are unnatural intrusions into natural processes, the more
that investigators deploy multiple approaches that control for those variables (and possible
errors) and that can support results, the more those results will appear confirmed. To reiterate:
If an obvious, confirmatory test is not carried out, the investigators should be prepared to
explain why.
Ultimately, selective data reporting retards the efficiency and momentum of scientific
discovery; it can waste huge amounts of money; and, as the Vioxx case illustrated, it can pose
great harm to research participants and health care consumers. As Marco and Larkin have
pointed out, scientific research that is publicly funded but that is incompetently or unethically
performed is a violation of the social contract in research.
That contract at least anticipates the 
truthful and honest reporting of research data in return for the funds that make the
experiments possible. The investigator who knowingly and intentionally reports only that
fraction of his data that puts his experiment in the best light has reneged on the social contract
and has fallen victim to his self-interests. And because scientific research and clinical care are
inevitably self-policing, succumbing to such selfish inclinations might not only harm the public
that scientific research is supposed to benefit, but end the careers of otherwise talented and
hard-working investigators.


","%Introduction:
This dilemma addresses the ethical implications of selective reporting in scientific research, specifically when faced with contradictory experimental results and the temptation to report only favorable findings.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The main factors include the integrity of scientific reporting, the reliability of different assay methods, the responsibility to report complete findings, and the potential impact on scientific progress. The tension between the desire for positive results and the obligation for truthful reporting is central to this case.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The Vioxx scandal serves as a cautionary tale about selective reporting, demonstrating how omitting unfavorable data can lead to catastrophic consequences. The case illustrates how selective reporting violates the social contract between researchers and the public, potentially endangering public health and eroding trust in scientific institutions.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The expert recommends multiple approaches: using multiple experimental methods when possible, reporting all results (including contradictory ones), seeking peer advice on presenting discrepant findings, and providing clear explanations for any unexplored testing options. When contradictory results exist, transparency about all findings is crucial.

%Key Takeaways:
Scientific integrity requires complete and honest reporting of all experimental results, even when they're contradictory. Selective reporting not only violates ethical principles but can also harm public health, waste resources, and damage scientific progress. Multiple experimental approaches and transparency are essential for maintaining research integrity.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma highlights the ethical challenges of selective reporting in scientific research, where the temptation to present only favorable results can compromise the integrity of findings and the trust in scientific inquiry.', 'Key Factors': 'Key factors include the integrity of data reporting, the potential consequences of selective reporting, the importance of multiple assay results, and the ethical obligation to provide a complete and honest account of research findings.', 'Historical & Theoretical Perspectives': 'The Vioxx scandal serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of selective reporting, illustrating how omitting critical data can lead to public harm and erode trust in scientific research.

This ethical dilemma revolves around the challenge of handling contradictory experimental results in scientific research, where the pressure to publish may conflict with the obligation to report findings accurately and transparently. The situation raises questions about integrity, interpretation of data, and the responsibility of researchers to present all relevant findings, even when they are inconsistent.

12,"By the time a researcher is a post-Doc, the odds are pretty good that he or she has probably heard if not
actually experienced an instance of an individual leaving a lab and taking his or her lab notebook along.
For obvious reasons, this frequently causes a great deal of emotional upset in the lab—not because the
research itself is of earth shattering importance but because the act raises the question of who really
owns the data and who has the right to control its dissemination.
The standard answer in academic research is that the University owns the data and the research
findings, but it is hard to convince an investigator of that when he or she is the one whose ideas
generated and whose work produced that data. So, what usually happens is that months of back and
forth communications go on, with the PI or the lab director trying to persuade the individual to return
his or her lab notebook, even though the University will often allow the individual to make and keep a
photocopy.
This kind of case always raises the following questions: Does the investigator have any right to
the ideas he or she developed while working at the lab? What considerations should this person make if
he tries to publish that data? How should such a situation be managed?","In his book Scientific Integrity, Francis Macrina notes that “Laboratory data books are the definitive
sources of data and facts.”1, p. 232
 He also points out that:
 An investigator who is taking over an ongoing project will naturally look to the lab notebooks for
definitive information on the experiments;
 The NIH can legally audit and examine data relevant to a grant it has awarded and might want to
inspect the source material;
 Data notebooks can be crucial sources of information to patent examiners, while litigation
involving patents might require the original data books for evidence.
There don’t appear to be any regulations for maintaining or managing the contents of laboratory
notebooks, so a great deal of variation can exist from lab to lab or institution to institution. This is
unfortunate because if universal standards existed that were robustly enforced—such as requiring all
investigators to update a master notebook maintained by the PI—the departure of a post-Doc such as
described in this scenario might not be all that traumatic. As it is, however, the post-Doc’s abrupt exit
with his (and, let us assume, others’) data might set the experiment or the entire research project back
considerably, possibly irreversibly. Furthermore, if the post-Doc leaves for another country, recovering
the data might be next to impossible.
While an investigator can insist that the data he generated in the lab is his by virtue of his labor,2
such stubborn insistence does not make the claim true. To the extent that a grant is made to an
institution by an external grantor like the NIH, the institution is the grantee, not its investigators. By
virtue of their employment, the investigators’ labors are purchased by the institution in return for which
the investigators perform the work promised in the grant.3
 Typically, the research will be carried out on
the institution’s premises with its technology, employees, and equipment—all of which underlines the
fact, made explicit in the grant award documentation as well as in the original employment contract or
letter of understanding between the institution and its investigators, that the institution owns the fruits
of its investigators’ labors. Usually, the only thing that will alter the institution’s ownership of data or its
intellectual property rights will be a 1) separate, legally enforceable contractual understanding with the
investigators such that they retain some portion of the intellectual property interest, or 2) an institution
might have a contractual understanding with a commercial grantor like a pharmaceutical company such
that the grantor will own the data. In this case, however, let us assume that the investigator’s abrupt 
departure with his lab notebook and other research data is a violation of his contractual obligation to
the institution and, therefore, minimally represents a theft. The question then becomes what is the
institution’s best course of action?
Certainly, the institution can sue the post-Doc, but if he has absconded with the materials to the
other side of the world, waging a lawsuit might be more trouble than it’s worth. We might turn the
question around, however, and ask “What can the post-Doc do with these data?” Suppose he tries to
publish them, but does not include any other investigators as authors even though he includes their
findings in the paper. If he publishes a paper with himself as sole author, he will then be taking credit
for certain work that is not his. This would constitute blatant misconduct, e.g., plagiarism, fraud,
misrepresentation, etc. Alternatively, if he attempts to contact other investigators and involve them in
writing the manuscript, they would be well advised to refuse co-operation until their institution is
satisfied that its intellectual property rights to these data are honored.
If the post-Doc totally refuses to co-operate but secures employment with another research
institution, the investigator’s former PI or lab director might contact the investigator’s new employer
and explain the situation. This might induce the new employer to correct the situation by imposing
pressure on the post-Doc to return the data. Alternatively, the threat of a well-publicized complaint
against the investigator and the damage it might do to his career might make him think hard about the
consequences of keeping the data. Of course, if the investigator’s new employer is as morally vacuous
as he is and values the data out of self-interest, that institution will similarly risk violating intellectual
property rights and invite patient infringement litigation should it pursue research using the pilfered
data.
Investigators at institutions must have a clear and explicit understanding of their contractual
obligations and the ownership status of the work products they evolve. To the extent that an employer
can show that a reasonable attempt was made to have employees gain a reasonable understanding of
who owns what—for example, was the explanation conveyed in the investigator’s native language?—
the investigator’s moral turpitude is all the more blatant and unjustified.
Ultimately, it is worth considering that the investigator might have his way about this, cause
profound damage to the institution he left, and not suffer much, if at all, by way of penalty. Regardless
of whether the investigator’s intentions were to sabotage the lab or steal the data for his personal gain,
or whether he just stubbornly believes that the data are his no matter what, the institution might decide
that the fight to have the data returned isn’t worth the effort. On the other hand, not prosecuting or
failing to lodge a professional complaint about the investigator’s conduct seems to condone it. Whether
the investigator did or did not remain in the United States, the institution would be remiss if it didn’t
inform the research entity at which this investigator might secure future employment of his data theft.
Alternatively, the institution might contact any professional organizations with which the investigator is
involved or is a member and inform them of the incident.
Perhaps the best, although not foolproof, way to protect against something like this happening
is for the PI to insist that the experiment’s master log or master notebook is updated regularly and that
all the investigators in the lab feel supported and respected. We do not know why this investigator left,
but if his departure was motivated by vengeance or hatred, supportive and respectful leadership and an
insistence on professionalism among the lab’s staff might have prevented it.","%Introduction:
This dilemma addresses the complex issue of data ownership and control in academic research settings, specifically when researchers leave laboratories with their notebooks and data, creating conflicts between personal and institutional claims to research materials.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The primary factors include institutional ownership rights, contractual obligations of researchers, the practical value of laboratory notebooks as definitive data sources, and the potential impact on ongoing research projects. The accessibility of data for audits, patent examinations, and project continuity must also be considered.

13,"A number of fairly recent articles appearing in Nature and other journals over the last few years have
worried about the possibility of investigators’ manipulating images for publication. For example, in a
2006 on-line issue of Nature (at www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature04996.html) Dale
Benos noted that:
[D]igital image-processing programs make it a simple matter to prettify ugly gels. Unwanted
background, smudges and ‘non-specific’ bands can be easily removed from the final figure. I
have always thought that showing only a single band of interest in a figure such as a western
blot or immunoprecipitation experiment is a somewhat equivocal practice, although I admit I
have done it…If images are manipulated to enhance what we aim to demonstrate, even if our
intentions are good, we chip away at the integrity of the scientific enterprise and erase the trust
that the public places in our work.
So, are there any rules of thumb that investigators might use to distinguish allowable from unallowable
uses of image manipulaton? Or should only raw images be submitted to journal editors?","Obviously, digital images are data upon whose accuracy the scientific community depends. Just as the
data that appear in the tables of lab reports can be misrepresented or fabricated, so can digital imagery
data. A primary but not always realized source for misrepresenting digital imagery data consists in the
fact that each individual element of the image, called a pixel, has a numerical value reflecting an RGB
(red/green/blue) intensity. Image processing that alters that intensity can improve the visualization of
the data. But if that image alteration mischaracterizes the data, one has gone too far. “Honest” ethical
dilemmas lie in the gray zone between enhancing the image such that its clarity is improved (but its
perceived content has not essentially changed) versus enhancing the image such that it now suggests
what is, in reality, not there. So, for example, because software image filters change the numerical data
in the pixels, they can create image artifacts leading to misinterpretation. As such, they are usually not
recommended for biological images.
The resolution of dilemmas over whether or not an investigator has gone too far in manipulating
an image is very simple: The investigator should make an unaltered, raw image of the data and retain it,
preferably in the original file format. This image is never altered or enhanced; only its copies are. If the
investigator honestly believes that an altered version of the original image is preferable for publication,
he or she should attach both a copy of the original and the altered image to the manuscript being
submitted along with a detailed description of why and how the copied image was altered. The journal
editors can then decide which image to publish. If the altered image is chosen, the nature of the
alteration should be described in the figure legend and explained in the methodology section of the
paper. That way, both the investigator and the journal will maintain transparency so that no accusations
of deception or misrepresentation will stand. In a nutshell, that’s how to resolve this problem, when it is
provoked by honest consternation of whether or not some kind of image manipulation is allowable. The 
remainder of this opinion will discuss various technical details and considerations associated with digital
image manipulation that Cromey includes in his article.
Cromey begins his remarks with a reminder about the importance of safeguarding and protecting the
unaltered, original image because accusations of misconduct will stand or fall based on whether or not
the original is available to compare with its copies. Indeed, investigators whose work falls under the
FDA’s “Final Rule on Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures” must maintain the integrity of
the original image. Similarly, industries whose work products are used in forensic activities or in HIPAArelated aspects of health care might be required to maintain an original image.
Cromey suggests that adjustments to the original image that are usually acceptable are small
adjustments in brightness and contrast or reasonable adjustments of the levels and gamma settings.
Although cropping an image is usually acceptable, accusations of unethical cropping will occur when the
cropping distorts the image, e.g., cropping so as to omit something that contradicts the investigator’s
hypothesis. If cropping yields a special, “one of a kind” image rather than a representative picture, then
the cropping has been performed unethically. Sound guideline language is found in the Journal of Cell
Biology’s Instructions to Authors (2007) in that image adjustments must not “obscure, eliminate, or
misrepresent any information present in the original” and that the original itself must fairly represent
the reality of the image such that multiple micrographs can attest to the same empirical reality.
(Available at http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml). Cromey also makes the following
recommendations:
(1) Digital images that are to be compared to one another should be acquired under identical
processing considerations. If they are not, the reason should be explained in the publication or
in the figure legend.
(2) Enhancing a specific area of an image is extremely questionable. If performed, the selective
enhancement(s) must be identified and explained. Similarly, because they can create artifacts in
an image, the use of software filters that can lead to misinterpretation are questionable.
(3) Copying objects from one part of an image to another part is extremely problematic while “the
use of cloning techniques to create objects in an image that did not exist there originally (e.g.,
creating a new gel band) is completely unethical.”
(4) JPEG compression reduces the file size but it also changes the XY resolution of the image and the
intensity value of any given pixel. This kind of compression should be avoided and replaced by a
TIF file format.
(5) Care should be exercised when changing the pixel size of a digital image. Decreasing image size
will decrease the image’s resolution. Increasing image size can cause the software to “guess” at
how many pixels need to be created between the existing ones. If the total number of pixels in
an image is going to change because of a manipulation, it should be done only once to limit the
number of artifacts that might be introduced.
Cromey believes that investigators who overuse image editing such that it becomes morally problematic
probably do so from ignorance rather than malevolence. Nevertheless, we might end with Cromey’s
quoting this stern warning from the Journal of Cell Biology’s 2007 Instructions to Authors:
All digital images in manuscripts accepted for publication will be scrutinized by our production
department for any indication of improper manipulation. Questions raised by the production
department will be referred to the Editors, who will request the original data from the authors
for comparison to the prepared figures. If the original data cannot be produced, the acceptance
of the manuscript may be revoked. Cases of deliberate misrepresentation of data will result in 
revocation of acceptance, and will be reported to the corresponding author’s home institution
of funding agency. (Available at http://www.jcb.org/misc/ifora.shtml)
Consequently, if moral arguments that discourage image misrepresentation don’t impress or persuade
the investigator bent on deception, perhaps the self-interest setbacks that await him or her upon being
found out will discourage the act.

14,"Labs A & B had been collaborating for some time, leading to a publication that appeared
in a very prestigious journal. Some months later, Mary, who is a researcher from Lab A,
visited Lab B to learn a technique used in the paper. While there, she became highly
suspicious of the technique that the lab technicians and researchers were using. When
she questioned them, they were very vague in their explanations and never really
showed her how to do the experiment that she visited to learn. When she returned and
reported all this to her PI, he decided to do an experiment on his own. Instead of
sending the next batch of dissolved protein to Lab B as it was expecting, Mary's PI sent
pure water. Lab B generated data from the water. Mary's PI then called the PI of Lab B,
who denied wrongdoing and broke off the collaboration. Mary's PI did not publicly
report the false data, however, for fear that the earlier paper the labs had co-authored
might be suspected of data manipulation.
The PI from Lab B was clearly in an ethical bind. On the one hand, it certainly
appeared he had an obligation to report falsified data. On the other, he has an
obligation to protect his lab's future. The retraction of a previously published paper in a
very high impact journal would put his career and the future of his and his collaborator's
labs in jeopardy. Indeed, the consequences of a blemish to one PI's ethical conduct
would affect everyone else in the labs as they attempt to procure future funding and
jobs.
My PI appeared to feel more obligated to protect his lab's interests since he was
not involved in any fabrication, and had no proof of wrongdoing related to the
published paper. Still, these kinds of instances are probably not all that uncommon,
leading one to wonder how much data fabrication and fraud exist in scientific literature.","This case offers the opportunity to examine how data manipulation or fabrication
relates to the moral significance of scientific research as well as to the obligation to
report suspicions of research misconduct.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Research Integrity (ORI), research misconduct is defined as the “fabrication, falsification,
or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research
results.” The fabrication of research data not only violates ORI mandates but is
unequivocally repudiated by most professional organizations as a violation of the most
basic ethical standards of research conduct. Caplan has remarked that individuals who
lie about research data suffer from a failure of morals, while Hofmann offers the
important insight that certain moral norms—particularly openness, honesty, and
truthfulness—are so important to the practice of scientific research, that their presence
or absence serves to distinguish between what can be considered science or non-science.
Because anyone can submit false or fabricated “data,” Hoffman argues that “(T)he
assessment of whether a work holds scientific quality appears to be less dependent on 
the results or consequences of a certain type of work, than on moral norms.” Telling
the truth, honestly reporting data, and not “creating” data are so morally fundamental
to the scientific enterprise that their absence contradicts the activity calling itself
“science.” The primacy of knowledge production is a fundamental element of science
that requires absolute faithfulness to honesty and truth telling.
In this case, the data submitted on the specimen of water may well have been
fabricated. Both PIs should at least be suspicious about the incident and, clearly, both
bear responsibility for managing it. But while it was certainly appropriate for the PI of
Lab A to report the findings to the PI of Lab B, now what? What about further reporting
this incident?
The Guidelines for Responsible Conduct of Research issued by ORI in January
2007 state the following:
 Reporting suspected research misconduct is a shared and serious responsibility
of all members of the academic community. Any person who suspects research
misconduct has an obligation to report the allegation to the dean of the unit in
which the suspected misconduct occurred or to the Research Integrity Officer.
Allegations are handled under procedures described in the University's Research
Integrity Policy. All reports are treated confidentially to the extent possible, and
no adverse action will be taken, either directly or indirectly, against a person
who makes such an allegation in good faith. Protection of whistleblowers against
retaliation is guaranteed under policies of both the University and the federal
and state governments.
The Research Integrity Officer must report findings of research
misconduct to the funding agency, and in some cases even an allegation must be
reported at some stage of the investigation. But even with this mandate on handling research misconduct, institutional policies can
vary widely, leaving the reporting of a particular incident of possible data fabrication like
the one described above subject to the interpretation of the particular institution’s
policies.
There seems to be clear evidence that researchers and institutions interpret this
mandate in a very narrow way, suggesting a severe under-reporting of misconduct. ORI
reports an average of 24 institutional investigational reports on research misconduct per
year. However, in 2006 ORI surveyed researchers about their own observations of
misconduct over a 3 year period. They concluded that a very conservative estimate of
observed possible research misconduct could be as high as 2,325 incidents per year,
almost 100 times the actual rate of reported investigations.
In analyzing why there is so much under-reporting, ORI identified a multitude of
institution-wide circumstances and recommended a number of strategies including a
zero tolerance for misconduct, protecting whistleblowers, defining clear mechanisms for
reporting misconduct, better training of mentors, identifying alternative mechanisms to
review and evaluate research misconduct, and modeling of ethical behavior.
In the above case, the ethical response would be to report it. A reasonable
approach would be for the PI in Lab A (which received the faulty data) to report this 
directly to his compliance officer. Most likely, the compliance officer would then
contact the appropriate official responsible for Lab B, assuming Lab B is at another
institution. That officer would investigate the current complaint and could decide to
more broadly investigate other data generated by Lab B. While this may culminate in a
formal investigation and perhaps call into question the data reported in the previously
published paper, the PI from Lab A has positioned himself on the moral high ground
rather than in an overt or covert cover-up. Indeed, looking to more practical
considerations, many scientific fields are so competitive that incorrect or falsified data
are readily identified by competitors. To the extent that it is discovered that the PIs
remained mum about the possibility of fabricated data, both their reputations may be
sullied.
As a final note, one wonders if there shouldn’t be an “intermediary” stage of
investigation somewhere between the two PIs and a Research Integrity Office (RIO).
Notice that the clinical environment has such an intermediate stage in the form of the
“incident” report that goes to risk management. Risk management, which strongly
encourages a nonpunitive/blameless posture, then investigates the claim with a view to
targeting those system weaknesses that contribute to or facilitate the incident and that
need repair. But such a more benign sounding intermediary doesn’t seem to exist in a
research environment. One simply takes one’s suspicions to the RIO, whose title
conjures up a ruthless instrument of justice. Of course, the two entities would be rather
different in that clinical/risk management scenarios typically witness no intentional
misconduct, insurance coverage exists for negligences, and so forth, while in the
research analogue we are envisioning, one might see intentional falsification, no
insurance coverage, reputation at serious risk, and so on. So, perhaps the research
intermediary we are proposing could be tried on a pilot basis and “choreographed” with
a view to providing as much support to those involved as possible. As it currently exists
in suspicions about research misconduct, if one wonders why such suspicions remain
under an institution’s official moral radar screen, the fear inducing nature of the RIO
may be an answer.
Summary: Any fabrication of data is research misconduct and seriously undermines the
basic integrity of science and scientific research. As such it is never acceptable.
Responsible conduct of research requires that incidents of suspected fabrication of data
be reported so that an appropriate investigation can be conducted and actions to
correct the data and prevent further misconduct needed to assure integrity is
maintained. This will take institutional support for a culture of integrity as well as
appropriate actions on the part of the individual researcher.

15,"I recall an uncomfortable period in a lab where I worked a few years ago. The lab was
productive, and the personnel worked reasonably well together. We had a number of very
intelligent and hard-working investigators who were trained in foreign countries—some of
them with MDs—but their English writing skills were poor. Nevertheless, these individuals
conceived the experimental designs of their projects and collected and interpreted the data.
Somehow, though, they managed to get the project’s PI to write their papers entirely, but with
them as first, second, etc., authors and with the PI as last.
The PI was comfortable with this arrangement. The problem arose when a postdoc was
asked to write these investigators’ papers. She didn’t like the arrangement one bit. As far as
she was concerned, she hadn’t participated in the investigators’ research and so shouldn’t be
writing their papers. And even if she had participated to some extent, she felt that writing their
papers entirely by herself was unreasonably time-consuming. Furthermore, she argued that if
she would write such a paper entirely by herself, then she deserved first authorship, regardless
of the amount of work she devoted to the project itself.
A sort of truce was reached when the postdoc let everyone know that if she became
more involved in the investigators’ research from the beginning, she would be willing to do the
writing if they did most of the data gathering. She still objected, though, to the investigators
being listed as first authors without their writing or editing anything. But she compromised on
a number of occasions to maintain peace and productivity.
Sometime later, both she and I left the lab. I’ve often wondered whether this situation
continued. Please comment. ","This scenario raises the interesting problem of the putative difference between “writing” a
paper—where one effortfully translates his or her thoughts into some form of symbolic
notation like words or images—versus “authoring” a paper where the “ideas” might be the
author’s but the words that ultimately appear in print could be those of someone else, like a
ghostwriter. Obviously, most authors are also writers: They fashion words of their own
choosing into sentences, paragraphs, articles, books, etc. But is it necessarily the case that all
writers are also authors? Setting words to paper doesn’t necessarily constitute “authorship” as
in the case of those saintly medieval monks laboring for years in their monasteries’ scriptoria
copying manuscripts. Alternatively, what should we say about a pharmaceutical company’s
ghostwriter, who interviews a researcher, learns the researcher’s methods and findings, and
then writes a paper which the researcher reads, approves, and claims authorship of? Is this
unethical if, in fact, the researcher did all the work but had the ghostwriter write the paper? If
it is unethical, then what are we to say about a sizeable portion of many law review articles as
well as appellate and (virtually all) Supreme Court decisions that are mostly written by law
students and clerks, who are never cited as authors? (Nor, for that matter, are Presidential
speechwriters.)
To gain further appreciation of this problem, the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors guidelines are maddeningly vague as to whether or not an author of a scientific
article must actually “write” any of it. The (notorious) section of the guidelines states that:
Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and
design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and 3) final approval of
the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2 and 3.1
Note that these stipulations do not explicitly state that authors must actually, i.e., physically,
write the paper’s sentences as they appear in final manuscript form. While the first author
might have conceived and refined the research idea and methodology, collected and
interpreted the data, and finally contemplated its meaning, the articulation of these activities
into symbolic language that takes the ultimate form of a manuscript might be some other,
anonymous person’s doing. Indeed, one suspects that this has happened often in the history of
scientific publication.
Something like this is going on in the above scenario. The investigators have been
spoiled by their remarkably benevolent PI’s writing their papers. The new postdoc, however,
objects to writing their papers because “She hadn’t participated in the investigators’ research.”
Certainly, the postdoc’s objection is on strong grounds. It seems a very poor use of her time to
ask her to write another group’s papers, whose research she hadn’t participated in. Indeed,
one might argue that even if she did write the papers she could not ethically claim any kind of
authorship credit because, by her own admission, she did none of the research. The postdoc’s
contention that “if she wrote a paper entirely, she deserved first authorship” is entirely
incorrect according to the ICMJE guidelines if she did none of the research. On that basis, she is
simply recording someone else’s ideas, activities, and findings.
But does this analysis do an injustice to the postdoc’s actual activity in writing the
investigators’ papers? Is she simply “recording” that group’s work? Or is she instead having to
exercise a great deal of creative and intellectual work in drafting the paper, performing the
literature review, producing a finely tuned description of the research methodology, deciding
how to present the data in the most compelling fashion, and imaginatively considering what the
findings imply? If this latter description better captures the postdoc’s efforts—indeed,
anyone’s efforts who is put in her position—it is no wonder that she was upset at being placed
well down the authorship list, as she clearly was making a “significant intellectual contribution.”
The solution that was finally adopted by way of the postdoc’s becoming involved in the
group’s research from the start isn’t bad, but it leaves unanswered the perhaps unanswerable
question of precisely discerning and measuring one’s “intellectual contribution” to a paper so
as to allocate authorship status fairly. Even as the postdoc is now “more involved in the
investigators’ research from the beginning,” and even though she continues to write the
papers, her claim to first or even second authorship isn’t a foregone conclusion. First
authorship should still be a function of how the variables of “significant intellectual
contribution” as they are listed above play out.
As we have noted in previous case scenarios—see, for example, the cases “A Mess of
Authors,” “Deciding First Authorship,” and “The Tyrannical Principal Investigator” at
http://www.actsi.org/areas/erks/ethics/authorship.html.—an early negotiation that decides
the authorship order cannot be overemphasized. But in cases like the one above, we 
recommend the following prophylactic strategy: Insist that the investigators compose the first
draft of the manuscript. Surely, this would count as an unassailable intellectual contribution,
no matter how imperfect their language or syntax. Once composed, their rough draft can then
be handed over to someone else. If that person is the postdoc who is already involved in the
research and who has therefore already made an intellectual contribution, one would think her
additional effort in bringing the manuscript to a final form would argue strongly for her as first
author. But what if the paper were handed over to a ghostwriter?
If the ghostwriter plays only an editorial role, then he or she doesn’t deserve an
authorship credit. (Incidentally, neither does the PI who originally wrote the papers if he
played no substantive role in the research activity.) What can be done, however, is to cite the
ghostwriter’s editorial contribution as an acknowledgement, perhaps at the end of the paper.
For its part, research universities that have significant numbers of personnel doing
intellectual work but whose English composition skills are substandard might consider having
those employees enroll in English language proficiency programs from the very start.
Nevertheless, we shall end with the moral reminder that authors are authors because they
make “intellectual” contributions to the work. The ambiguity of that term, however, will
doubtlessly account for dilemmas like the one above surfacing occasionally and requiring
careful consideration. ","Here's the structured analysis with the requested formatting:

%Introduction:
This case explores the complex relationship between writing and authorship in academic publishing, specifically when researchers with limited English writing abilities rely on others to compose their papers.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The distinction between ""writing"" versus ""authoring"" a paper is central to this dilemma. The postdoc's objection stems from both time investment concerns and questions of intellectual contribution. The role of language barriers in scientific communication and fair attribution of credit are also key considerations.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines provide a framework for authorship, though they remain somewhat ambiguous on the writing requirement. This reflects a broader historical pattern in academia where ghostwriting and editorial assistance have played significant but often unacknowledged roles.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The expert recommends having investigators write the first draft regardless of language quality, followed by editorial assistance. Universities should provide English language training for international researchers. Clear authorship negotiations should occur at project initiation, with editorial contributions acknowledged separately from authorship.

%Key Takeaways:
Authorship should be based on intellectual contribution rather than writing ability alone. A balance must be struck between supporting researchers with limited English skills and maintaining fair attribution of credit. Clear policies and early communication about roles and credit are essential for preventing conflicts.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma highlights the complexities of authorship in scientific research, particularly when contributions are misaligned with the writing process.

This ethical dilemma revolves around authorship disputes in academic research, particularly in scenarios where contributors with strong experimental skills but weak writing abilities rely heavily on others to draft their papers. The situation raises questions about fair authorship allocation, the value of different contributions, and the balance between collaboration and individual recognition.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the distinction between intellectual contribution (experimental design, data collection) and technical contribution (writing, editing), the power dynamics between PIs and junior researchers, and the ethical norms of authorship in academia. The postdoc’s concerns highlight the tension between fairness and practicality in collaborative research environments.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, authorship norms have evolved to recognize both intellectual and writing contributions, as seen in guidelines like the ICMJE criteria. Theoretical perspectives, such as Merton’s Matthew Effect, suggest that credit often accumulates disproportionately to established researchers, while junior contributors may struggle for recognition. This case reflects broader challenges in equitable credit distribution.  

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
One approach is to establish clear, lab-wide authorship policies upfront, defining roles and expectations for writing and data contribution. Mediation by a neutral party or ethics committee could help resolve disputes. Alternatively, collaborative writing workshops could empower non-native English speakers to contribute more equally, reducing reliance on others for drafting.  

%Key Takeaways:  
This case underscores the need for transparent authorship policies and open communication in research teams.

16,"This dilemma occurred some years ago when I was in high school. I was taking a biology course
from a teacher I greatly respected. He was passionate about his subject; he took pains to teach
it well; and I was doing well in the class.
Toward the end of the year, however, I became distressed over an upcoming project
that would involve a dissection. While I will not argue about the pros and cons of animal
experimentation, I felt then (and still do) that gathering up thousands of frogs, cats, fetal pigs,
etc. for high school students (many of whom will go to college and study history or interior
design) is simply a gross waste of life. At the very least, I believe that an honest conscientious
objection such as mine constituted a reasonable justification for the teacher's assigning a
substitute activity for the dissection project.
To say he disagreed with me would be putting it mildly. He was insistent that dissection
was a mandatory part of the class and that if I refused to participate, my current grade of A
would become a C. He also informed me that he was under no obligation from the school to
accommodate me or my objections, claiming that ""morals have no place in my classroom.""
Fortunately, the school administrators were more understanding, once my irate mother
called. They insisted that my teacher would have to prepare an alternative assignment for me
or any other student who did not wish to participate in the dissection. He went along, but only
after telling me he was doing so against his will. I also remember a remarkable threat: that if
he so much as caught me or any other dissenter wearing a leather belt, he would fail us.
Ultimately, two other students and I completed the alternative assignment—which was
more than twice the workload of the dissection project—and I kept my A for the course. But
my relationship with the teacher was never the same. I could no longer respect him as I once
had. I felt he had ignored my values and my rights and had only yielded from force and with
bitterness.
On the other hand, a dilemma like mine raises the larger question about the limits of
conscientious objection among science students. Suppose a student refuses to do an
assignment because he (or his parents) objects to certain anatomical drawings in his textbook,
or that he does not wish to participate in classes on reproduction, or learning about the
construction of the atomic bomb? How might one discriminate between ethically reasonable
versus unreasonable objections to certain material in science curricula?","In some states, students enjoy a legal right to exemption from animal dissection exercises under state statutory law or administrative policy. Resources for students and their parents regarding legal rights to exemption are available from the Humane Society of the United States1 and the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Assuming students do not enjoy a legal right to exemption, how should teachers and school administrators respond to the ethical issues posed by the dilemma contributor? Two options are considered here: eliminating animal dissection exercises from K-12 science curricula altogether or continuing the use of these exercises but granting exemptions to conscientious objectors. Elimination of Animal Dissection Exercises Assuming that, as a matter of biological-scientific literacy, school children ought to acquire basic knowledge about animal anatomy, can and should the mode of instruction be revised to eliminate animal dissection exercises and employ alternatives? Effective and affordable alternatives are increasingly available. These include charts, slides, dissection manuals, 3D models, simulators, manikins, preserved materials, computer emulations and simulations, films, photographs, video, interactive video, Internet presentations, and virtual simulators.3 Employing these alternatives would sacrifice some depth of knowledge that can only be attained by animal dissection.4 But, if there are ethical concerns associated with the “transportation, holding, and killing” of “six million vertebrates” per year in the U.S, as estimated in 2004 for use in animal dissection exercises,5 should we consider substituting good if not perfect alternatives? In a diverse society, we will disagree about the moral significance of harm to animals and the weight it should be given in our analysis. But even as the debate persists, our laws, policies, and practices indicate broad acknowledgement across diverse worldviews that harm to animals is morally significant, can be justified only for worthy purposes, and should be minimized. For example, while most of us continue to use animals for food and clothing, laws and polices prohibit pointless acts of animal cruelty and neglect and regulate the use of animals in research. Current regulations governing animal research aim to ensure that animals are used only for worthwhile purposes; measures are undertaken to minimize suffering, imposition on quality of life, and premature loss of life; and consideration is given to methods that can accomplish the research goals without the use of animals.6 Given currently available alternatives to teaching students the basics of animal anatomy and given the moral significance and extent of the harm to animals caused by current practices, there is reason to consider whether we should eliminate animal dissection exercises in some school science curricula. If we cannot justify the use in light of the pedagogic purposes of the exercises, then continued use would amount to a “gross waste of life.” Exemption from Animal Dissection Exercises The dilemma contributor obviously believes that his or her right to adhere to his or her values should have been honored, willingly and respectfully. But the contributor recognizes that students in a diverse society hold diverse values and puzzles about how we might distinguish “ethically reasonable” from “ethically unreasonable” objections. The ethical questions surrounding conscience claims involve a tension between the scope of individual liberty when motivated by conscience and the scope of authority of those institutions that make it possible for diverse individuals to live together in peace, flourish, and enjoy a maximum range of liberty. The questioner claimed and eventually was granted an “ethical right” to conscientious exemption. But the questioner anticipates the resulting chaos if all members of a diverse student body could claim conscientious exemption from any and all science curricular requirements. So, how might we distinguish “reasonable” from “unreasonable” claims? We must resolve the tension between 1) the scope of individual liberty motivated by conscience and 2) the scope of institutional authority necessary to bind together a diverse community so that its members can live in peace, flourish, and enjoy a maximum range of liberty. When a claim for exemption is based on dissenting beliefs that are widely held and the exemption would not undermine the purposes of the curricular requirement, granting the exemption is a sensible, practical way to resolve the tension. For example, state legislatures have granted exemptions for underage use of wine as a sacrament in violation of state laws prohibiting underage drinking; the sacramental use of wine is widely engaged in and the practice does not implicate the health and safety concerns underlying underage drinking laws. Even if dissenting beliefs are not widely held, if compliance with the curricular requirement would substantially burden the student’s conscience and exemption would not undermine the purposes of the curricular requirement, granting the exemption also makes sense given the serious harm to individual conscience entailed in enforcing the requirement. So, for example, state legislatures have also granted exemptions for the sacramental use of peyote even though only a very few religious believers engage in this practice and given that sacramental use does not implicate the health and safety concerns underlying criminal prohibitions of peyote. In the dilemma contributor’s case, engaging in an exercise that would contribute to a “gross waste of life” would likely impose a substantial burden on the contributor’s conscience. This would seem to justify an “ethical right” to exemption given the ready availability of goodenough alternatives. Also, in light of the current-day availability of alternatives, widespread requests for exemption by students who object because they find dissecting animals to be repulsive—even if they cannot explain how engaging in the exercise would substantially burden their conscience—might be warranted as well. Doing so would avoid the practical difficulties of enforcing a requirement that is widely objected to and would grant that repulsion is sometimes, although not always, a marker of moral discomfort even if the person experiencing the repulsion cannot immediately articulate the moral objection. So, if biology teachers continue to require animal dissection exercises because they believe the pedagogic benefits justify the use of animals in this way, it would make sense to tell students at the outset of the animal anatomy portion of a course that the teacher believes that these dissection exercises are the best way to learn the material and to explain how the animals used in the exercise have been procured to answer any concerns students might have, for example, about the treatment of the animals in transportation or their preparation for use in dissection. The teacher could then add that students are entitled to perform alternative assignments if they find the exercises offensive or in violation of their moral beliefs. The Ethics of Other Conscientious Exemptions In some cases, as with animal dissection exercises, conscientious objectors will claim exemption from the mode of teaching truths about the natural world. In other cases, they may claim exemption from exposure to the content of these truths. The fundamental tension between the scope of individual conscience and of institutional authority is implicated in both cases, but the latter poses more difficult challenges to the ethical framework for resolving this tension because, if the exemptions are granted, the objectors might not realize some or all of the pedagogic purposes of the curricular requirements. Exposure to human anatomical drawings or instruction in the biology of human reproduction without explanation of the significance of sexual behavior in a religious context might substantially burden the conscience of some. In both of these examples, the objection is partly to mode and partly to content. So some of the pedagogic purposes of the curricular requirements might be met by alternative modes of instruction, for example, descriptions rather than depictions of anatomy or the substitution of instruction in reproduction in the home or a religious institution. With respect to learning about the construction of the atomic bomb, the objection would run almost entirely to content. Instruction in the content might substantially burden the conscience of those who believe it is unethical to teach truths when knowledge of these truths has in the past and might in the future contribute to consequences that the objector believes are profoundly immoral. Alternatives for the objector might require substitution of different content, for example, a historical account of a different scientific and engineering feat. At least in the case of requirements that would impose a substantial burden, given the corrosiveness to the educational experience of compelled compliance, exemptions might be granted even if realization of the pedagogical purpose for the objectors can only be partly achieved. This approach to determining the reasonableness of claimed ethical rights to exemption would seem especially important in the public school setting. If rights to exemption are not honored in public schools, this may increasingly drive individuals to private schools in which worldviews are shared and conflicts are unlikely to arise. Honoring these rights in public schools preserves the possibility of an educational meeting place for students with diverse worldviews, where teachers and learners can model reasonable accommodation of conscientious objectors, and where objections, such as those of the questioner, might prove to be the leading edge of revising prevailing views of how science should be taught.
Summary: ""Oftentimes, ethical dilemmas require numerous inputs and creative ideas
that exceed what one or two people can conjure up. Labs should be encouraged to
think and brainstorm collectively about the ethical dilemmas that occur among
researchers since, even if a satisfying resolution remains elusive, the fact that a serious,
collective attempt is made might relieve some of the moral distress that a dilemma like
this can cause.""","%Introduction:
This dilemma addresses the ethical considerations surrounding animal dissection in educational settings, particularly focusing on students' rights to conscientious objection and the balance between educational requirements and personal moral values.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The primary factors include the availability of alternative teaching methods, the moral significance of animal welfare, the pedagogical value of dissection, and the balance between institutional authority and individual conscience. The tension between maintaining educational standards and respecting diverse moral viewpoints must also be considered.

This ethical dilemma revolves around the conflict between a student's conscientious objection to animal dissection and a teacher's insistence on adhering to traditional curriculum requirements. The situation highlights broader questions about the limits of accommodating personal beliefs in educational settings and the balance between academic rigor and ethical considerations.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the student's deeply held ethical beliefs, the teacher's commitment to a standardized curriculum, the school's role in mediating such disputes, and the potential slippery slope of accommodating objections in science education. The power dynamics between students, teachers, and administrators also play a critical role in resolving such conflicts.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, conscientious objection in education has been debated in contexts ranging from religious exemptions to controversial scientific topics. Theoretical frameworks like Kohlberg's stages of moral development and ethical pluralism can shed light on how individuals and institutions navigate such conflicts. The tension between academic freedom and ethical accommodation is a recurring theme in educational philosophy.  

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
One approach is for schools to establish clear policies for accommodating conscientious objections, ensuring they are applied consistently and fairly. This could involve alternative assignments that meet the same learning objectives without violating students' ethical principles. Open dialogue between students, teachers, and administrators is essential to foster mutual understanding and respect. Additionally, teacher training on handling ethical objections could prevent adversarial outcomes.

The situation highlights broader questions about the limits of accommodating personal beliefs in educational settings and the balance between academic rigor and ethical considerations.,"Key factors include the student's deeply held ethical beliefs, the teacher's commitment to a standardized curriculum, the school's role in mediating such disputes, and the potential slippery slope of accommodating objections in science education. The power dynamics between students, teachers, and administrators also play a critical role in resolving such conflicts.","Historically, conscientious objection in education has been debated in contexts ranging from religious exemptions to controversial scientific topics. Theoretical frameworks like Kohlberg's stages of moral development and ethical pluralism can shed light on how individuals and institutions navigate such conflicts. The tension between academic freedom and ethical accommodation is a recurring theme in educational philosophy.","One approach is for schools to establish clear policies for accommodating conscientious objections, ensuring they are applied consistently and fairly. This could involve alternative assignments that meet the same learning objectives without violating students' ethical principles. Open dialogue between students, teachers, and administrators is essential to foster mutual understanding and respect. Additionally, teacher training on handling ethical objections could prevent adversarial outcomes.","This case underscores the importance of balancing ethical sensitivity with educational standards.

17,"Some years ago, while I was still an undergraduate, I worked in a lab that did research
on topics pertaining to cardiothoracic surgery. Most of the projects in the lab used
animal subjects.
Our project required us to put mice to sleep by injecting chemicals, and then
cannulating their hearts while the hearts were still beating. This was quite difficult
because their aortas are very tiny and it was hard to insert the cannula without
puncturing the vessel. Initially, the plan was to perfect the cannulation procedure on
normal mice, and then perform the procedure on genetically mutant mice that would be
provided to us by collaborators.
In retrospect, neither the other student nor myself had the experience to be able
to perform this intricate surgical procedure. We ended up sacrificing many mice,
without ever being able to establish a working model. I believe we sacrificed these mice
needlessly due to our inexperience and, in fact, the inexperience of our research team.
Ironically, a week after we stopped doing the procedure, a surgical fellow visiting from a
foreign country took over the project and after sacrificing only a few mice was able to
develop a working model within a week.
It might be expected that researchers become desensitized given the frequency
with which animals are sacrificed for experiments, but I continue to feel poorly about
the unnecessary sacrifice and suffering of animals.
What kinds of ethical recommendations might this situation invite in order to
diminish harm to laboratory animals?","Russell and Burch’s classic 1959 text, The Principles of Humane Experimental
Technique, offered the “3Rs”—replace, reduce, refine—to guide ethical sensibilities
about animal use in research. Continuing today as a popular moral reference on the
ethical use of animals, the 3Rs recommend that researchers 1) replace methods that use
animals with those that do not (assuming that research findings or extrapolations are
not compromised by the replacement), 2) reduce the number of animals used (such as
laboratories coordinating their sharing laboratory animals, or taking multiple tissues
simultaneously from a single animal), and 3) refine existing procedures such that
animals experience less pain and distress (e.g., by administering tranquilizers or
analgesics).
The professional distress the researcher relates in this dilemma seems
appropriate since the scenario involves a situation where animals might indeed have
been needlessly sacrificed. Perhaps much of the dilemma could have been eliminated if
the researcher and his or her colleagues had, very early on, called the lab’s attention to
their difficulties in evolving a cannulation model. Doing so might have induced a
collective anxiety that could have resulted in some creative ideas from other laboratory
personnel to contain the problem. The researcher does mention, however, that the 
entire research team was inexperienced in the methodology, which suggests that a
collective realization of the same might have stimulated a search for a remediative
strategy sooner rather than later. In fact, it seems entirely fair to ask whether this
experiment should have even been launched, given the way the absent skill set
compromised the ethical use of laboratory animals.
Clearly, the skill set that the researchers lacked was obviously within reach if the
surgical fellow had little difficulty in evolving a model. Their problem was a lack of
awareness that, combined with a lack of support or advice regarding a model, might
have made the actual number of mice that were sacrificed seem inordinately large
(when the actual number might have been small). This case clearly posed the
psychological challenge to the investigator to become callous to the death of an animal
for the sake of the investigator’s advantage (career advancement, publications, etc.).
This is an important reality that keeps many wonderful people out of research biology
and/or directs them to studies involving tissue culture, etc. It can feel as though with
each animal carcass tossed in the animal bag, one is also tossing a bit of one’s soul or
spirit away. If the sacrifice ultimately led to generalizable data, then the animal deaths
might not have been in vain; but animal deaths that have no good outcome whatsoever
can hurt. The toxic effect of this experiment was not only on the mice but on the
investigator as well.
In any event, let us assume for the sake of argument that a “replacement”
approach, where the study could have been completed without laboratory animals, was
not feasible. Still, artificial mouse models constructed from laminate, vinyl, or latex
might have been available to afford practice opportunities. Also, the researchers could
have conducted a literature or computer search to determine if a cannulation model
was already discovered and described.
Indeed, they could have shared their problem with other labs in the interest of
locating one where cannulation training might be available and then visit that site and
be adequately trained. Quite possibly, the costs involved in such training would be
justified by the acquisition of the skill set, the opportunity of the researchers to teach it
to their peers, and whatever further benefits per future experiments might accrue with
duly trained personnel.
Even if that option was unavailable, however, the researchers might have
“scavenged” from other labs. They could have practiced on cadaveric mice or thoracic
sections from already sacrificed ones. Although perhaps unavailable when this dilemma
occurred, virtual reality training devices have come on the market, such as the P.O.P.
Simulator, which can be used for training in laparoscopic surgery.
Ultimately, the ethically beleaguered researchers seemed handicapped by
insufficient support that could have at least identified some possibilities whereby the
number of animals used in the project could have been reduced. Had they contacted
their Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), sage advice might have
been available. It might be worth pointing out, however, that the researcher’s
remarking about the mice “suffering” is arguable. To the extent that proper anesthesia
was used, there was little if any suffering. On the other hand, the needless use of 
animals is not only a waste of resources but deprives animals of their natural interest in
maintaining their welfare and self-preservation.","%Introduction:

18,"I worked with Dr. Z on data analysis that led to my writing a manuscript draft. Dr. Z
assisted with the data analysis but did not own the data and would not be senior author.
Upon reading my manuscript, Dr. Z said it was not acceptable for publication,
whereupon we then worked on it for 6 months. During that time, I would email him
revisions, which would come back with “not good enough” remarks, but little direction
for revision. When I evinced my frustration, he would say we were nearly done and I
just needed to work a little harder to complete it.
At the end of the 6 months, I decided I would leave Dr. Z’s lab. Dr. Z did not take
this at all kindly. In fact, he said some rather unflattering things about my work, and
stated that he wanted to submit the paper himself as first author and not even include
me as an author.
My new lab director Dr. N, who did own the data and to my mind had a clear
claim to being first author from the start, informed me about what Dr. Z was saying. Dr.
N said he felt I had the right to submit the paper myself and that we could remove Dr. Z
completely from authorship—which confused me even more. I wasn’t comfortable
going behind Dr. Z’s back, especially as he had originally made numerous suggestions
affecting the project’s design. But clearly, Dr. Z and Dr. N were at odds and I felt I could
easily get caught in their crossfire.
The primary question I was left with was how to sort this authorship mess out.
Dr. Z, in my mind, certainly deserved some authorship credit, but my current advisor
was disagreeing. Also, he insisted that I be first author, which was flattering but, I
thought, somewhat undeserved. As it turned out, the paper was never submitted. I feel
badly that it wasn’t. How could this mess have been worked out?","So, the projected paper never gets published, perhaps owing to the collapse of what
might be called “research virtues.” In their book, Responsible Conduct of Research,
Shamoo and Resnick offer the following as a kind of Aristotelian list of traits and
practices that are conducive to good research and as well as productive research
relationships
:
* Honesty * Openness * Freedom
* Objectivity * Confidentiality * Social Responsibility
* Integrity * Respect for Colleagues * Efficiency
* Carefulness * Respect for Intellectual Property * Education
 * Competence * Equality of Opportunity * Legality
 * Animal Care * Human Subjects Protection
Dr. Z and Dr. N appear very much to lack collegial respect, respect for intellectual
property, and objectivity. Furthermore, as the troubles start from Dr. Z’s consistent
rejections of the student’s revisions, accompanied by his failure to supply concrete,
constructive criticism, we might fault Dr. Z’s educative or mentoring style for leaving the 
student in the dark—a problem, it seems worth noting, that is not unknown in graduate
studies.
Once the student decides to quit Dr. Z’s lab and move to Dr. N’s, professorial
egoism seems to take over on both sides. We assume that Dr. Z is insulted by the move
and seeks to discredit the student’s claim to authorship. Dr. N on the other hand
suggests discrediting Dr. Z’s contributions entirely and having the student be first
author. No wonder the student is bewildered: Neither Dr. Z nor Dr. N appear to be
acting ethically or professionally but rather to be venting their spleens at one another
and dismissing customary rules of authorship.
Obviously, collaboration is essential in research and as Shamoo and Resnick
point out—although it is certainly a matter of common sense as well—there can be no
collaboration without trust, respect, integrity and collegiality. Drs. Z and N are hardly
setting a positive example.
While it is easy to imagine this clash of personalities occurring in a commercial
research lab, it is hard to imagine that it would result in the ultimate deliverable, i.e., a
decent manuscript, never seeing the light of publication. Management in industry
would doubtlessly have some sort of supervisory mechanism that would not have
allowed all this work to go for naught. What seems to be seriously lacking in this case is
an institutional mechanism that would not only recognize everyone’s contribution to
the work, but that would assist Dr. Z and Dr. N to work more collegially.
One wonders if the student had a mentor to whom he could have gone when he
started experiencing “issues” with Dr. Z. Was Dr. N his mentor? If so, then Dr. N could
have exerted some positive leadership but didn’t. Although it is a bit unclear—what was
the student doing with Dr. N’s data, working with Dr. Z in Dr. Z’s lab?—Dr. N seems to
lead the project, so he should have been made aware of what was going on between
the student and Dr. Z and have acted to attend to their communication problem. One
also worries that this is probably not the first time Dr. Z was vague in giving directions
and slowed a student’s professional momentum. (And Dr. Z needs to know about that.)
Perhaps this case is valuable in its illustrating what happens when professorial
narcissism or egoism trumps the kinds of virtues that Shamoo and Resnick encourage.
Of course, human beings will come to disagree with one another, but it is lamentable
that they cannot agree to disagree agreeably.
In summary, to have averted these problem, the following might have worked:
Dr. Z should have been more thoughtful and explicit in advising the student. It
would probably have taken Dr. Z only a few minutes to jot down some concrete
suggestions to the student every time an issue arose, rather than leave the
student to guess the intent of Dr. Z’s vague and imprecise suggestions (maybe
“musings” or “meanderings” are better words). This is a very serious failing on
Dr. Z’s part because it not only causes considerable consternation and anxiety on
the student’s part, but stymies the creative process, delays the project, and
slows the student’s career momentum.
The student should have felt comfortable in approaching Dr. Z and frankly
discussing his quandary, which Dr. Z should have taken to heart. Instead, the 
student and Dr. Z go limply back and forth for 6 months, until the student
decides to throw in the towel and move to Dr. N’s lab.
It is lamentable that the student felt he had to leave Dr. Z’s lab. Had there been
a mechanism in place to address the problems mentioned above, this might not
have had to happen. Where was the student’s advisor during all this? Was there
even one in place?
Upon coming to Dr. N’s lab, virtues like respect for colleagues and respect for
intellectual property should have held sway, rather than the acrimony that the
student describes. Dr. N should have sat down with Dr. Z to negotiate their
authorship arrangements in a professional way. The idea of neither Dr. Z nor the
student having authorship seems patently unjust to both.
The paper is never written because the principals didn’t try hard enough to
respect one another and set aside their differences. Perhaps there was an
institutional remedy—going to the lab director, section head, departmental
chair, dean, etc., but it was apparently refused.
In the end, one feels badly for the student as well as for science and the toil that goes
into. Surely the student was entitled to a professionally positive experience which,
given the likes of Dr. N and Z, didn’t happen. Just so, the student was entitled to the
recognition his work deserved, which failed to materialize as well. Thus, this case is a
good example of how a failure in professional comportment or relational behaviors can
spoil the interests of science and the educational process.

This ethical dilemma revolves around authorship disputes in academic research, where conflicting claims and unclear contributions lead to unresolved tensions and unsubmitted work. The situation highlights the challenges of fair credit allocation, especially when multiple advisors are involved and power dynamics come into play.  

%Key Factors in Consideration:  
Key factors include the ownership of the data (Dr. N), the extent of Dr. Z’s contributions (both intellectual and editorial), and the ethical implications of excluding or including authors. The power imbalance between the student and the advisors, as well as the lack of clear communication and guidelines for authorship, further complicate the issue.  

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  
Historically, authorship disputes are common in academia, often stemming from vague criteria for contribution. Theoretical frameworks like the ICMJE guidelines emphasize substantive intellectual contributions as the basis for authorship, while ethical principles such as fairness and transparency are critical in resolving such conflicts.  

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  
A mediated discussion involving all parties (student, Dr. Z, and Dr. N) could clarify contributions and align expectations. Alternatively, consulting institutional authorship policies or an ethics committee could provide an objective assessment. Clear documentation of contributions and early agreement on authorship roles could prevent future disputes.  

%Key Takeaways:  
Authorship conflicts can derail research productivity and damage professional relationships. Establishing clear authorship criteria upfront, fostering open communication, and seeking neutral mediation when disputes arise are essential for resolving such dilemmas ethically and effectively.","This ethical dilemma revolves around authorship disputes in academic research, where conflicting claims and unclear contributions lead to unresolved tensions and unsubmitted work.

19,"My principal investigator (PI) was preparing a manuscript for publication and had
planned to submit it to a high impact journal. After people in the department were
made aware of the project and of its novelty, it was thought that the manuscript would
likely be accepted.
At that point, my PI was approached by numerous clinicians and postdocs
claiming that they had contributed significantly to this work and should be considered
manuscript authors. Having worked closely with the first author of the project, granting
authorship to these presumptive authors struck me as ridiculous. One of them claimed
authorship because he had provided a common dye reagent. Another, whom we hardly
ever saw in our lab, claimed it was his idea to do certain experiments that were
published in the manuscript—a claim that no one could remember. And there were
others.
Although my PI knew these authorship demands were unfounded, he clearly felt
pressure as a nontenured faculty member to cooperate with certain postdocs because
they had worked in highly productive labs of prominent tenured researchers, and my PI
did not want to sour those relationships. Ultimately, there were a lot of backroom
negotiations and discussions and two additional authors were added to the manuscript.
In my opinion, however, they had contributed nothing to the manuscript.
The paper was eventually accepted in a very influential journal. So it was quite
ironic to have our Medical School, a few months later, publish an editorial chastising the
increasing number of ""phantom"" authors on papers that were being published by the
School's researchers.","Anyone who has been in a research environment for more than a year has probably
observed or been involved in some sort of authorship dispute. As academic ‘currency,’
authorship is the way credit is assigned. It has become the primary way researchers are
judged and careers are made. A major contribution (often indicated by first or last
authorship) on an important paper (as rated by colleagues in the field) in a high–impact
journal (as measured by citation rates) can have a significant and lasting effect on a
person’s career. It is no wonder that one of the first things budding scientists learn is
“publish or perish.”
Given the importance we have assigned to authorship, many researchers feel
pressure to make sure their name appears on as many papers as possible. But being
listed as an author on a paper without having made a significant contribution to the
work does a disservice to the field, to the general scientific community, and to the
public.
To combat ‘phantom’ or ‘ghost’ authorship, the International Committee of
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) prepared “Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts 
Submitted to Biomedical Journals.”1
 In the document, the ICMJE recommends explicit
and stringent criteria for bestowing authorship, including
• Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions
to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and
interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically
for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the
version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to
take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.
The ICMJE recommendations are not binding, so journals have established their own
guidelines for determining who should be an author, Some, like the Journal of the
American Medical Association2
, have adopted the ICMJE guidelines and require each
author to indicate what her contribution was to the work. Others, like Nature3
, Science4
,
and Cell5
, simply remind corresponding authors of the responsibilities of submission and
dispute resolution. But the adoption of guidelines does not guarantee their use or
enforcement. So what is an ethical scientist to do?
 Read the authorship guidelines for the journal to which you plan to submit
your manuscript. Read the guidelines for all the journals in your fields. Talk
about them with you colleagues.
 Talk early and often about authorship of your future papers. When you first
plan a research path, talk about who the authors might be. Revisit that
conversation frequently as your research progresses.
 Model good behavior. This is particularly important for deans, department
chairs and other influential researchers who help set the standards of
behavior for the scientific community. The “top-down” approach helps
protect junior professors who may not want to risk their careers by refusing
ghost authorship.
 Remember that authorship is a responsibility. This responsibility applies
when credit is given for good work, when explanations about the work are
needed, and when blame is assigned for inaccurate or unethical work.
Authors should be prepared to accept responsibility for the work under all
these circumstances.
Regarding the above scenario, the ICMJE guidelines explicitly state that “Acquisition of
funding, collecting of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not
justify authorship.” 1
Thus, the time-honored practices of bestowing authorship simply
because so-and-so is the lab director, or has supplied a reagent, or is a noted authority
in the field whose name as an author might accelerate acceptance of the article are
unethical. Authors must make a “substantive intellectual contribution” to the article 
and either drafted or revised it. Otherwise, their contribution might be acknowledged
at the end of the article, but it does not qualify them as authors.
Finally, consider the case of Gerald Schatten, a University of Pittsburgh
professor. He was a senior author on a 2005 Science paper from the lab of Hwang WooSuk, a stem cell researcher, who was later shown to have fabricated much of his
published data. According to the San Francisco Gate, “Schatten did not contribute to
the science but was listed as senior author and shared in the ensuing fame for serving as
an ‘adviser’… He recently tried to extricate himself from the disaster by asking Science to
take his name off the paper. Science declined, saying that senior authors have a
responsibility to know what is going on","%Introduction:
The dilemma centers on the critical issue of authorship attribution in academic publishing, where career pressures and institutional dynamics can lead to questionable practices in credit allocation.

%Key Factors in Consideration:
The primary factors include the pressure on non-tenured faculty to maintain relationships with influential colleagues, the distinction between substantial and peripheral contributions to research, and the conflict between institutional ethical standards and actual practices. The value of authorship as academic currency also plays a crucial role in driving behavior.

%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has established clear guidelines for authorship attribution, requiring substantial intellectual contribution, manuscript drafting/revision, and final approval. Different journals have adopted varying approaches to implementing these standards, though enforcement remains challenging.

%Proposed Resolution Strategies:
The expert recommends several practical approaches: studying and discussing journal authorship guidelines with colleagues, establishing early and ongoing conversations about authorship expectations, modeling ethical behavior especially by senior researchers, and maintaining awareness that authorship carries both privileges and responsibilities.

%Key Takeaways:
Phantom authorship undermines scientific integrity and should be rejected despite institutional pressures. Clear guidelines exist but require consistent enforcement. Authors must make substantive intellectual contributions to merit authorship, and simply providing materials or holding authority positions does not justify authorship credit.","{'gpt': {'Introduction': 'This dilemma highlights the ethical complexities surrounding authorship in academic publishing, particularly the pressure to include individuals who may not have made significant contributions to the research.', 'Key Factors': 'Key factors include the criteria for authorship as outlined by the ICMJE, the distinction between substantial contributions and mere involvement, and the impact of institutional pressures on decision-making regarding authorship.', 'Historical & Theoretical Perspectives': 'The issue of authorship disputes is well-documented in academic literature, with guidelines from organizations like the ICMJE aiming to combat ""phantom"" authorship.

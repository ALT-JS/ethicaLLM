"I think you should talk to the PI about this problem and ask for an opportunity to get a three-people talk in person. After then, you should always keep a lab note, clearly indicating who has done which experiment, to avoid the misalignments in information again.","Credit for lab work is often ambiguous as it is oftentimes impossible to achieve a discovery without the help of an entire team. It is true that without his efforts your discovery would not have happened as his work no doubt played a role in your discovery. In that sense, the discovery should not be credited to only you alone, but rather to the entire team. That being said, it is obviously ridiculous that the senior partner decided to take credit for your discovery and even more preposterous when he laughed in your face. Consequently, you should immediately get your PI involved as, although credit for the discovery should go to the team, within the team, you should deserve the credit.","I think your contribution to the result cannot be ignored, because even though the project is this postdoc's, your contribution should be marked on this work of synthesizing the key compound. So for now, first of all, you should give your feedback to the PI to fight for your intellectual rights, and if the PI doesn't recognize your point of view either, then you should give your feedback to a higher leader in the lab and make it known to a wider audience to get support.","I should, because of the key procedures and results are my work. People who come up with an idea and people who do the work are all coontributors."
"I think student A contributed to most of the project, though the early stage idea is from student B. Student A shouldn't act as not knowing and add student B into the acknowledgment and thanks of the project paper. Meanwhile, the plagiarism claim from student B also doesn't stand because doing research is always a kind of racing: whoever gets the outcome first is the king. Student A and B should build up trust between each other again, or select to talk less about their possible personal project ideas.","In the scenario, it seems like in Student A and Student B¡¯s original conversation, Student B suggested an idea that maybe was not fully formed or, at the very least, was unable to identify the value of the idea. As such, this scenario should be determined plagiarism depending on the degree of which Student A copied and the how much of an idea Student B actually gave. If Student A was simply inspired by Student B¡¯s set of words, it would be hard to justify plagiarism. However, if Student B feels as if Student A basically took her idea, Student B should start to collect evidence and open a case to her school board. On a side note, it is imperative that Student A should not have kept Student B in the dark.","I think it is difficult to judge whether the situation is academic plagiarism from the information we already have, because in that description, Student B told Student A about a relatively novel experimental idea, but it is difficult to judge what percent of Student A's final output was Student A's own contribution. However, although it is difficult to determine whether the situation is academic plagiarism, in principle, Student A should not have started the project in secret without telling Student B, and should have mentioned Student B in the acknowledgements of his paper.","The behaviour of student A is improper. Student A should first tell student B and get her approval. Also, this must be mentioned in the acknowledgement."
"I think it's appropriate for David to list him as the first author. And it's also appropriate for David to rewrite all the manuscripts without informing the original technician, because the technician had chosen to leave the group abandoning his original work. But I think the PI still need to inform the original author(the technician) about the changes made to the paper and the author placement.","Since it sounds like the technician sort of ¡°threw away¡± the paper, I believe it is fine for David to replace the original manuscript with a reformed one. The moment the technician left the lab, it was his responsibility to keep in touch with David and contact and aid him with respect to the paper. Unless the technically specifically request to be contacted, he should not be surprised that his rejected paper was revamped and upgraded. In addition, it seems as though David changed a significant portion of the pape, as such, it is not ridiculous to label himself as the main author. That being said, credit should still be given to the technician no doubt.","Since David almost rewrote the manuscript, it is reasonable for him to replace the original author as the first author. Since the technician had left the laboratory before rewriting the manuscript, I think David has no obligation to inform the technician of the revision of the manuscript and does not need to obtain his permission in advance. But I think the name of the technician should be mentioned in the acknowledgments/contributions to show recognition and respect for his previous work.",I think David's behaviour should be known by that technician and be agreed. It's improper for David to directly be the first author and change everything without the technician's approval.
"I think it's appropriate for the PI to stop his research in the old school after he moved to a new school, but the previous projects should at least get the original author/students informed of the changes in authors and projects, while trying to complete online research with the students still want to participate in.","This is not ethical at all. Authorship of a paper should not change based on his switch to his university. The moment he switched, he should no longer have the presumptive authority as a PI in his old lab and should therefore not have a say in any research conducted there. Furthermore, editing manuscripts that came from the old lab should come with notifications to the older team. ","I don't think this is ethical. First of all, the PI can decide to rewrite a manuscript that has already been prepared, but he should not adjust the order of authors based on whether the author is a new member. In addition, I also think that the PI does not have absolute authority over previous work.",It's improper. Everything should be fair. He should not be too harsh on members of his old lab who do not join him after that.
"Although every advisor like Dr. Big will expect his postdocs to have a nice job in the future, he is not responsible for his students and doing this would harm Dee when she find herself incapable of the work she has been assigned at work. George should follow his own will of doing this for Dr. Big, but it's wrong for Dr. Big to do all those things for Dee.","To glorify a person during any application or instance where you have to market yourself in almost common practice today. We must, however, draw a hard line between glorification and fabrication, the former being relatively expected while the latter is within the realms of unethical. In this scenario, I believe George should evaluate if her qualities were ¡°embellished¡± or misleading to the point where it¡¯s basically deception. Of course, the company that would want to hire her will need to do the due diligence to analyze whether her application is fitting or not.","There is no doubt that Dr. Bigs' behavior was unethical, including but not limited to designating the first author of the paper instead of the contribution to the paper according to his own will and falsifying/exaggerating the content of the recommendation letter. For George, it is obviously not a decent thing to remain silent, and it also damages his academic reputation as a member of the laboratory.",Dr. Big should not behave like that. He should be fair and honest to Dee Nye. Who is the first author and issues like recommendation letters should be completely true and honest.
"There definitely need to have patients who contribute to the mass public to let doctors/researchers to do the lung research to increase the chance of survivals on future surgeries, at the risk of his own live. But doing this type of things still need to have the patients agreement and not to do it secretly without the permission of the patient or patient's family.","In the first dilemma, it seems highly debatable on what method saves the most lives. As such, it seems the root of the problem is the lack of research or understanding within the subject matter; it seems both the aggressive follow-up and the alternative have their pros and cons. As for the second dilemma, the original poster is exactly correct on the medical field being ¡°hardly a perfect science.¡± As such, when it comes to dangerous data collection, two questions must be asked: how potential risks and what are the benefits? Which side simply outweighs the other?","I think the key point in both of the above ethical issues is whether the patient is informed. I don't think transplant personnel can choose the ""more ethical"" option for the patient in these two issues. Instead, what transplant personnel can do is to inform the patient of all the pros and cons, risks, and various possible situations of their plan.",It reflects the conflicts between patients and long-term scientific progress. I think it's necessary to prior patients' health.
"We have to discuss the problem clear: if Dr. Smith is sharing a in group or in university research from his friend professors or other lab members, Dr. Smith should still ask for his student's permission to share the experiment results. If Dr Smith is actually reviewing for a conference or journal and sent others research work to his lab member, that should be banned and it's really bad.","It¡¯s hard to know the ethical implications without any further knowledge of Dr. Smith¡¯s mysterious manuscript and what he really means by ¡°I¡¯ve got a ton of them.¡± Naturally, if this means that he has many unsubmitted/scrapped papers that he is just holding onto, it is his right to give his work and manuscripts away to Jane as it is his intellectual property. On the flip side, if this was not his paper, say one of his students wrote it, this is where it becomes highly unethical. Without explicit notification to the original author of the paper, Dr. Smith should not share any of the information to an outside source.","I think Dr. Smith's behavior is undoubtedly against academic ethics. We may speculate that the rationale for the manuscript she gave to Jane came from Dr. Smith's own manuscript, but if this speculation is true, then she would not ask Jane not to tell anyone about the existence of the manuscript and not to copy it. The only reasonable explanation is that Dr. Smith is a reviewer of a journal, and the manuscript is an academic article that the contributor surrenders to the journal. In this case, Dr. Smith's behavior is very unethical.",Dr. Smith must tell the author before doing so.
Dr Smith is too keen on finding research results that match his schedule and direction so that he deliberately force the patients and his lab members to do experiments outside the scope of what has been told to the test patients. This is strongly unethical way of treating things. Research and papers are not the only thing. It is right to leave the lab. You should also work with your friends to unveil the nasty behavior of Dr Smith.,"It seems plainly obvious that Dr. Smith was well aware of his unethical practices. There are plenty of laws regulating consent for medical tests in which making a decision for someone because they entered a facility is definitely not one of them. When it comes to the grant, again, Dr. Smith is very well aware of his shadiness. He is no doubt offering a misleading narrative and even arguably threatening his employees. Although it is true that patient confidentiality remains an utmost concern, it seems like he didn¡¯t even get formal consent.","Dr. Smith's behavior is undoubtedly unethical. Patients should be informed of all information and risks before participating in any medical procedures and whether to participate in medical research, but Dr. Smith made the decision for them. In addition, Dr. Smith even threatened his team not to disclose the incident.","Dr. Smith has the power-of-attorney, but should make decisions based on what's good for them, instead of his own research. The research must be done in a fair and honest way."
"I think it's OK as long as you, as the subject, was strictly following the setup and the experiment of your planning and don't secretly edit the result. But only one person isn't enough, you still need to find more subjects for your experiment.","When recruiting yourself for your own study, ethical concerns only arise if the situation actually creates a conflict of interest. In other words, if you yourself are expecting an outcome or contain bias about your own experiment, using yourself will lead to not just biased results, but also ethical concerns. Consequently, whether recruiting yourself is unethical or not is heavily dependent on the specific scenario. In the original poster's case, it seems perfectly clear that using himself would not arise any problems, as long as it was mentioned in the abstract. Of course, reproducibility is a large part of experiments, so it is expected that he can reproduce himself with those later subjects.","I think recruiting yourself for an experiment is not unethical in itself, but what is really unethical is recruiting yourself in order to make your own experiment present the desired results and influence the content of the experiment. But no matter what, recruiting yourself can only provide a subject for your own research, which is far from enough in most cases.",One can only participate in his own experiment only if knowing the contents in advance does not influence the outcomes.
"I think it's more down to a religious behavior and hope in their heart of the experiment going on as they planned. Normally it won't affect the results of the experiment, and I think it's okay for them to do so. This is still ethical.","Whether spirituality in the lab is ethical seems rather context dependent more so than black and white answers. The prayer and religion itself do not raise any ethical concerns, but, in the event where it affects the outcomes of the study, due to being overly hopeful, for example, it can raise some ethical concerns. Furthermore, if it¡¯s praying for exactly one outcome from the experiment, this could cause a plethora of different biases that will affect the study. Of course, you could really argue this about anything, as such, the prayer itself should be deemed ethical as long as the outcome isn¡¯t skewed.","I think the key to this matter is not to pray for the experimental results themselves. If, as described in the text, these researchers did not directly affect the experimental results, then this matter would not be so ethical. But in fact, I think this kind of prayer behavior is a reflection of the inner expectations of the experimental results. If the researchers intervene in the experimental data to a certain extent because of their obsession, then this is undoubtedly unethical, but this matter is actually irrelevant to the prayer itself.","I think praying in this way doesn't really influence the outcome, it's just hoping for the expected outcome. It's their right to do so."
"From Dr. Smith's perspective, it's important to report nice results to someone above in order to gain fame and reputation, on the basis of you being a not that experienced senior student, there may still be a way to replicate the results of the previous study. From your perspective, you think Dr. Smith is cheating and reporting the fake stuff, but he also balanced his situation for the final decision.","To glorify a person during any application or instance where you have to market yourself in almost common practice today. We must, however, draw a hard line between glorification and fabrication, the former being relatively expected while the latter is within the realms of unethical. In the scenario, omitting the truth could be considered lying and a misrepresentation of the current experiment; however, it is hard to know without any further context. Consequently, the information about the failed trials should not be omitted. If, for example, there is evidence that the samples actually were contaminated and that this wasn¡¯t wishful thinking, the failures should not only be mentioned but an idea of how to resolve them should be stated as well.","From a factual perspective, it is indeed unethical for Dr. Smith to conceal the fact that he failed to repeat the experiment, because the sponsor has the right to know the full true results of his experiment. But from a certain perspective, what Dr. Smith said is not completely unreasonable, because after all, this experiment once obtained those interesting data, and the current inability to reproduce may be due to negligence in a certain step during the experiment. However, as long as Dr. Smith and the person describing the problem still try to reproduce the experimental data later, Dr. Smith's remarks cannot be said to be completely deceptive.","It's not good, but it's not cheating, because everything mentioned is true."
"If there's no third assay, this may still requires extra work to do with the Y thing, if you really desired it to be valid so that you can make significant impact to the related researches. But if you choose to neglect the second assay, your work will not withstand the test of time and will be corrected by others, and it will also affect your own future studies because you are working based on a unproven hypothesis. So you shouldn't publish the research neglecting the second assay if there's no third assay.","The original poster is correct in that when the question remains up in the air, more information is needed. However, they ask an interesting question on what if more information is unobtainable through a third assay. For starters, both assays should be mentioned in the paper even if you heavily believe in favor of the first one; selectively picking which data to go with in the publishcation is strongly unethical. As such, I suggest drilling down and theorizing the reasoning behind the different results. If there is sufficient evidence that the 2nd assay failed for a particular reason, in the paper, you should mention that and strongly highlight the idea. In other words, you should wait until you have more information to make an informed decision on what you believe in and what you publish whether that was with a 3rd assay or not.","If there is no third test available, I think you need to report the true results of the first two tests in the report. If you are more inclined to one of the first two test results, you can also explain this point of view in the report and argue your reasons. In addition, you can also explain why you think the other experimental result may not be ideal. But in any case, it is important to report all your experimental results truthfully. As for the right or wrong of its argument, these can allow readers or subsequent researchers to further ponder or experiment.","If a third method doesn't exist, we should report the contradiction and explore another way. Otherwise try to seek for special cases in the existing methods."
"This kind of thing always requires the leaving investigator to talk with the professor or PI. The PI may has been the source of some ideas, but it's the investigator that does all the things. If it cannot be peacefully determined. The university has the right to keep the research work that is under its supervision.","Whether the person has the rights to publish the idea that came out of the lab for themselves is heavily dependent on the lab and is often signed into contract before they even start working in the lab. In most labs, the research is owned by the university as they provide the materials and infrastructure, and, therefore, if one were to leave the lab, they should request permission from the lab to publish it themselves. That being said, if the person can oftentimes come to an agreement with the PI or the university and go from there.","I think researchers have the right to keep the ideas they have while working in the lab. But when it comes to data and publication, I think it is a more complicated situation and should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. But it is important for researchers to maintain good communication with their previous labs and respect the lab's ideas and outputs while respecting their own research data.","Contributions should be considered. If it's hard to divide, they should communicate. One shouldn't take things away if those are not all his contributions."
"I think this is more down to everybody's conscience to maintain the integrity of the test result pictures to be correct and can be replicated. Photoshopping does help the investigators to show the main results more clearly if they are hard to spot, but there has been cases of faking images to get nice results for acceptance in journals or conferences. One should always provide their modifications in words to the original picture, otherwise it's unethical.","How much images get manipulated and how misleading the edited image will naturally affect the credibility of the journal. Modifying a picture is ethically grey; however, this happens so often within the internet today that it really isn¡¯t deemed as a horrible act or even unethical at this point. Journals risk their credibility by releasing synthetic stories as opposed to their ethics.","I think the key to this issue is not whether researchers should be able to identify over-processed research images, which is only a passive prevention. What is really important is to take the initiative to prevent researchers who publish research content from having the motivation to tamper with experimental results by beautifying images. If beautifying experimental images is just to make the conclusions that are already reflected in the images more obvious, then I don¡¯t think it is unethical; but if beautifying experimental images misleads readers, it is undoubtedly a tampering of experimental results. Of course, only allowing original images to be submitted to journals is an effective way to prevent the above phenomenon.","If it is just to standardize brightness, etc., and does not affect authenticity, then it should be allowed. If it is a forgery, etc., then it must be prohibited."
The lab B is unethical about their experiment results. Faking the experiment results is a very unethical behaviour. Lab B should cease the related research around the fake experiment and the fake results.,"From an ethical standpoint, falsifying data is obviously unethical. Putting aside the future of the labs or the careers of the people, if all we care about is ethics, Lab B should have never falsified data nor should Lab A allow them to get away with it. Lab A should try to recreate the experiment and replace Lab B¡¯s finding entirely. Of course, in the real world, people must balance their ethical views with their obligations. It is understandable why both labs did what they did, but, as mentioned before, ethical speaking, they are both in the wrong.","First of all, I think both approaches have their own considerations, but the problem is that even if they do not make these fraudulent data public, if they have previously published articles in very well-known journals using these data, then data fraud is easy to be discovered. And when data fraud is discovered in this case instead of Lab A taking the initiative to report, it will have a huge negative impact on the academic reputation of Lab A. On the contrary, if Lab A now takes the initiative to report, and was previously unaware of the data fraud in its partner lab, then Lab A actually has no academic integrity issues.","In cooperation, one is also responsible for the behavior of the partner."
"Paper writing has always been one part of the whole research, and the projects should let the investigators to do the writing. If the investigators are not doing reading, at least let someone that is good at english writing to be at least the leading author of the research.","A large part of doing research is writing and interpreting the results yourself. Consequently, the investigators should have written the papers themselves with the aid from someone else, rather than that someone else writing their entire paper for them. It does not make sense to be the first author on a paper if none of the words written on the paper is from that author even if they were a large part of the experiments. ","I think the postdoc's claim is reasonable. The paper is the main means of outputting arguments for the entire research, and its author should be the person who participates in most of the experimental design, data collection and interpretation. Because only in this way can one have a sufficient understanding of the experiment and output reasonable and accurate arguments.",It is understandable that such an arrangement would not be accepted. Effective communication is the best way to resolve these issues.
"I think it's fair for a teacher to encourage students to do the animal related things in a biology class, maybe it helps students to understand biology more and perform better in future biology learning in college. But the teacher's behaviour of forcing other students reluctant to do so is really bad and unethical. One teacher should never force the students to do this kind of things.","There are many cases similar to this one from a law standpoint rather than an ethical one. In law, each of these scenarios are dealt on a case by case basis, where it heavily depends on the situation for whether it's an unreasonable objection or not. If it impedes on ones freedom of religion, for instance, it could be ruled as unlawful. From an ethical standpoint, it again is case by case, but there is an extra layer of complication. For example, when it comes to a school course, the factor to consider is the expectation. If you are taking high school biology there is no expectation (at least not anymore) where you would have to dissect a frog; however, if you were to take a dissecting class in college, it would be nonsensical to make a conscientious objection about dissecting. Once the expectation is set, it is really up to the school whether they are able to accommodate the student or not.","I think both sides are wrong in this matter. First of all, from the students' perspective, dissection is indeed an irreplaceable project for some biology courses, and it is difficult to replace it with other homework projects. If students cannot accept dissection, then it is the students' responsibility to find out whether there is dissection homework before choosing this course. But from the teacher's perspective, his words were too intense, especially when he said ""morals have no place in my classroom."" This is undoubtedly a kind of disrespect for students.",I find it acceptable to refuse to do such experiments because of my own values. Teachers should respect the values and beliefs of their students.
"It's normal for beginners to struggle to inject chemicals to mice. Though it's sad to see so much mice sacrifising, it's still necessary to do so in order to be ethical to mice. The pros may have been experienced at doing this and finished the same with fewer loss to mice, but surely they also have one time when they also need to kill a lot of mice to get the injection working. And it's also not realistic for the students to always ask the surgical fellow to do the injection for them all the time.","The problem is not that mice are being used as test subjects, but the inexperience and lack of guidance from professionals that caused the unnecessary deaths. It it clear that they had this information and guidance available with the surgical fellow or another professor / PI. In addition, proper precautions and training on fake mice should have been implemented first in order to lessen the number of deaths. In other words, the first time students try to inject chemicals into a mouse should not be a real mouse. By the time they've gotten enough practice with fake mice, they would be far more experience and ready for a real one.","I think that for undergraduate medical students, the sacrifices brought about by this kind of practical experience are inevitable. Of course, the poster is not saying that mice should not be used to accumulate experience in clinical experiments, but that it is sad for the unnecessary sacrifice and suffering of animals. This is reasonable, and the way to reduce these harms is that before the actual hands-on operation, researchers can provide similar mouse models for inexperienced researchers to conduct more skill training and psychological preconditioning.","Priority should be given to the participation of trained individuals in such demanding experiments. In other words, alternative experiments should be prioritized if such sacrifices can be reduced."
"I think Dr. Z only wants a higher authorship for himself, and when he didn't make it, he just wanted to trouble you to continuously refine the paper. And Dr. N is also way to extreme for not having Dr. Z on the author list. With this kind of conflict going on, I would say that the paper not published is the best result. When you met this kind of problem, you should go for some university workers who can get contact with both professors, like a student advisor.","Authorship on a paper really should have nothing to do with personal relationships. As a result, both Dr. N and Dr. Z are ethically wrong. Since Dr. Z did contribute a substantial part of the paper, he should at least be an author even though his behavior is less than ideal. Of course, it is even more ridiculous that Dr. Z wanted to make himself the first author and not even add the student as the paper as well. It seems the student was caught between a sour relationship between Dr. N and Dr. Z. The only way out of this situation is to find a compromise between the three people.","I think both professors have certain ethical issues in assigning authorship to the paper. Dr. Z's problem is that the student has invested more than six months on the paper but he does not want the student to be the author; and Dr. N's problem is that due to his tense relationship with Professor Z, he does not want Dr. Z to be named on the paper, even though Dr. Z has made a considerable contribution to the paper. I think the root of this mess lies in the disagreement between Dr. N and Dr. Z. If these disagreements cannot be resolved, then the mess about this paper will be difficult to resolve.",This situation highlights the critical importance of establishing clear authorship agreements early in the research process. Miscommunication and conflicting expectations ultimately prevented valuable work from reaching publication.
"It's always vague when it comes to the author list, you only know the sequence of first second third author and etc., but you don't know how much they contribute to the project. It's clearly unethical for the PI to add people to the paper list who basically didn't do anything. Maybe PI just don't have other better ways to maintain the relationship between the clinicians and postdocs.","The shameless people asking for credit on the paper even though they didn't contribute are evidently ethically incorrect. You could also argue that the PI adding those two authors in the end is also in the wrong as well. The inherent problem is that the novel idea was made public to everyone, so everybody tried to get a piece of the pie putting pressure on the PI to accommodate unreasonable takes.","I think the problem described in the above situation is indeed unethical. One of the key points in this issue is that one of the people who claimed to be the author only provided common dye reagents, and such a contribution is indeed not enough to be considered as one of the authors. In addition, another key point is that the reason why the PI added these people as the final authors is that he did not want to destroy the relationship with the laboratory behind them, and this behavior of determining the authorship of the paper based on personal relationships is undoubtedly unethical.","Despite clear authorship guidelines, political considerations often lead to the inclusion of ""phantom"" authors, undermining the credibility of scientific publications."
"Dr. Jenkins is way too nice in this affair. Although it's normal for people not to be on the authorlist even they worked, in this problem, it's clear that sole author from you is way too much and adding Dr. Jenkins still make this paper a really strong proof of your personal ability.","It seems off that a person who actually contributed the paper doesn't want any credit, but, at the end of the day, it would be more unethical to force the other person to take credit. As a result, everything in this dilemma is ethically correct as the original poster can not force Dr. Jenkins to write his name on the paper and Dr. Jenkins has the right to refuse authorship.","There was nothing unethical about Dr. Jenkins's behavior. Dr. Jenkins did not ask for anything in exchange for the sole authorship, and Mary has a satisfying career in his lab. Moreover, Dr. Jenkins certainly has the right to refuse to be named as a sole author if his motives are justified.","I think there should be clear clarification and communication about the origin of this situation. In principle, there should be an honest division of authorship in order of merit."
"I think in this affair, Jim has the capability to determine the final authorship of the paper. Because he's responsible for all the beginning part of the paper. A relatively good ending should be you and Jim share first authorship since you made great contribution to the project.","Whether you become first author or not should be dependent on Jim, the current main author, rather than some third party. Since Jim was contacted and agreed he didn't want to work on the project anymore, it seems fine to take the first author as he gave up the responsibility of the paper when he moved away and neglected it. Alternatively, is it insane to suggests that both can be the main author on the paper? It seems like a rather fair compromise.","First of all, I want to say that there is no moral problem with the poster's choice, because it is a choice he made to stick to his own principles. But at the same time, it cannot be ignored that he did put a lot of effort into this paper, and the original first author said that he is not interested in the project now. So I think that perhaps asking the original first author for his opinion may also be a moral choice for the poster.","It is possible to change the author order, but I think it needs to be communicated to and recognized by the original first author."
"In this kind of situation, you should go for the university student advisors to address the problem, since it's unethical and you cannot handle the problem in the way you want and nor do your PI. Though it may break the relationship bbetween your lab and those researchers.","The original poster is very aware that the situation itself is very unethical and that, even though it is, he would still make the same decision again due to the cost of dissenting. Naturally, from an ethical standpoint, the ones shamelessly asking to add their name on the paper are in the wrong. The original poster is also in the wrong for adding the names; however, there is no such thing as a perfectly ethical life. In other words, from an ethical standpoint he is in the wrong, but from a logic standpoint, he is correct.","First of all, this is indeed an unethical thing to do. The main contradiction is that they do not understand the research content, which also violates the rule that paper authorship should not be assigned based on anything other than research contribution. But as the description of the problem says, even his supervisor is unable to solve this matter, let alone as a student. So I think the more reasonable and ethical solution is to continue to report it to researchers with higher positions in the laboratory and ask them for solutions.","One has no choice but to compromise when one is powerless to decide, but this phenomenon taints the integrity and purity of academia."
"It's strongly unethical for a vast majority of the researchers to oblige the authorship rule of the paper to add Dr. Wittgenstein as the author. But everybody is doing this, so this makes Dr. Cooper difficult to disclose everything, and Dr. Cooper is just a professor who is still on his tenure track and may get sacked due to not having enough publications. Maybe it's better to go with the flow first and then after tenure track finished to slowly get rid of this kind of behaviour.","In terms of ethics, Dr. Cooper is in the right as all he did was follow the rules. However, one can not be perfectly ethical at all times and one often (maybe even should) pick the less ethical option if the ethical way comes with too much cost. In this case, Dr. Cooper¡¯s tenure is at stake so it would be logically understandable to write the other guy's name on his paper even if it was against the rules.","Although every researcher will list the person who provided the reagents as the author out of courtesy, it is unethical for Dr. Wittgenstein to force Dr. Copper to add his name to the paper, and he should not retaliate by not providing reagents. But then again, Dr. Copper's laboratory has suffered huge losses because of this behavior, and according to the description of the problem, the reagents provided by Dr. Wittgenstein are also quite valuable, so for Dr. Copper, perhaps trying to find some balance between morality and reality is the best solution.","Dr. Cooper¡¯s experience highlights the unfortunate reality that strict adherence to ethical authorship standards can sometimes disadvantage individuals in a system that informally rewards unethical reciprocity. Without stronger community enforcement, those who prioritize integrity are often penalized, while those who exploit the system thrive."
"The statistician should have that much capability to do the whole thing from the beginning. If he wanted to do so, he should also remind to talk with the students and PI about the author issue and claim his work instead of just rewrite everything without everybody's notice and claim that he had done tons of work.","This situation is filled with unethical behavior starting from the fact that the statistician rewrote the paper without the main author¡¯s opinion! It¡¯s even more ludicrous that the professor becomes the first author after the fact that the statistician rewrote the paper! To answer the questions, if the author were to rewrite the paper with significant enhancements and with the knowledge of the primary author, you could make the case for said author to become the main author. In this scenario, however, neither of those things happened. As a graduate student, the only thing you can do is to find a better professor, which, of course, is easier said than done.","This is indeed unethical. The point here is that the statistician's suggestions are all easily adopted, so the contribution of rewriting a paper with other people's data should be far less than data collection and analysis. In addition, it is worth noting that the poster and the professor and other researchers in the laboratory have already reached an agreement on the order of authors, and this behavior of overturning the previous agreement without prior notice should not be accepted just because the professor has greater power in the laboratory.","Rewriting a manuscript without contributing to the underlying research does not ethically justify claiming first authorship. This situation reflects an abuse of power dynamics, where initial authorship agreements are disregarded at the expense of more vulnerable junior researchers."
"I think you can still use this donors samples, as long as the donor has capable health conditions that meets your research's needs. I think it's ethical to continuie to use as long as you don't disclose the donor's identity, after all, I don't think every paper disclose their testers' personal information.","As long as you think the identity would not skew the results, there shouldn¡¯t be any reason not to use the data, unless the patient, who should be notified that their identity was leaked, is against it. A breach of confidentiality is a big deal not for the people in the lab, but for the person who got their information leaked. Consequently, the PI should notify the patient of such a breach and go from their decision.","First of all, I think the key to the problem is that the laboratory should inform the donor of the current situation, that is, a small number of researchers already know the identity of the donor. After the truth is told, if the donor agrees that the researchers continue to use the sample, then it is not unethical to use the sample without revealing the donor's sample and identity in the paper.",I don't think it's inappropriate to continue to use this celebrity's cells; it's not unethical.

"I understand the fact that you want the recommendation letter from the professor, but I think you still cannot do such kind of things. First, reporting this kind of things to the professor already gives him a bad impression, which may affect the quality of the recommendation letter you expected. Second, this is an unethical thing to do and it's not contributing to the academic environment.","From the original poster¡¯s perspective, he was already aware that the scenario is ethical, but still it was logically sound to go with it anyway assuming his ad-hoc research wasn¡¯t totally nonsense. However, a large part of research is repeatability. After the graduate thesis is done, the lab should continue to further recreate the findings and actually determine if the correlation between them is real or not.","I think this situation is more due to the requirements of the school or the outside world on Dr. Allen or the laboratories. The most direct evidence is that Dr. Allen said that his laboratory would not issue a report without statistically significant findings. Perhaps it is the high requirements of the outside world for his laboratory that led Dr. Allen to demand such output from his laboratory. So I think that in addition to adding the practical significance of reviewing the reports of each laboratory, the solution to this problem may also lie in reducing the rigid quantity requirements of the outside world on each laboratory to ensure the practical significance of the research.","You should tell your mentor what you think. But in this case, I think most people would compromise."
Ethical data deletion requires the statisticians to explain what points do they deleted and why do they delete the things. Unethical data deletion is result centric and delibrate.,"It is ethical to delete data when you believe the data collected is due to some factor that has nothing to do with the underlying distribution. For example, if the machinery simply broke for a few data points or data points that don¡¯t make sense logically (like a negative age), those points should be removed as they are misrepresentative of what the data is. However, it is unethical to delete a few data points just to make your correlation look better.","I think the most critical distinction here is whether the scatter plot displayed by deletion or not changes the original conclusion of the experiment. In addition, no matter how the researchers modify the scatter plot, they should reflect this in their paper and clearly explain the reasons and their impact. Only in this way can it be done without violating ethical standards.","Deleting data points can be ethically acceptable when done according to predefined, transparent criteria that are scientifically justified. However, selectively removing data to produce cleaner or more favorable results constitutes a serious breach of research integrity."
"I think Jack should suggest Jill to work with him from the start. Even acknowledgement at the end of the paper is also not enough for Jill's contribution. Maybe adding Jill as the author, if agreed by Jill, was a way to make up jill's loss.","The idea itself is a large part of a research paper and should not be taken without permission from the original author.  Another factor to consider is that Jill¡¯s work seemed to already have substantial progress; it¡¯s not some loose ideas that haven¡¯t been applied yet.Consequently, Jack should for sure have included Jill as an author for the final paper. In fact, more than that, Jack should have kept Jill in the loop of his project as he seems to be straight up stealing.","Perhaps we can say that Jack did not steal Jill's work, but Jack's behavior is undoubtedly unethical. I think Jack should have suggested Jill to collaborate with him at the beginning, and the remedy for now is to list Jill as a co-author or add her to the acknowledgments according to Jill's wishes.","Jack shouldn't do this without informing Jill. Also, Jill's contributions should be included in related papers. Jack violated Jill's right of ideas."
"I think this type of experiment need to ask the local's permissions. Maybe measles still means something to the testers and they wanted to get rid of the disease with any attempt. Also, it ethical to test on local testers if you are aiming to help the locals, on the basis of permission.","Since the scientist hasn¡¯t even started his experiments, there is obviously nothing unethical going around. However, if he were to commit to this plan, he must abide by India¡¯s laws rather than the U.S., get explicit consent from all the patients, and have enough safety precautions that there is no risk.","As with all issues involving requesting subjects to participate in clinical trials, the key to this issue is to truthfully inform potential subjects of the significance and risks of participating in clinical trials and respect their wishes. I believe that if the above can be achieved, then the research is ethical.",Subjects' interests should be assured and they need to be informed of the potential risks.
"I think this needs further regulations applied from FDA. If the patients are at serious risk, and their family or the patient itself gave the doctor's the permission to use drugs on test for the treatment, then I think it's ethical for the doctors to provide not FDA permitted but test-proved medicine to the patients. After all, there have been more testers before this process when actually doing the experiment.",I mean what else is there to do except have the FDA work more efficiently by either putting other cases on hold or hiring more manpower. ,"I think this problem can be solved from two angles. One is to shorten the unnecessary approval process as much as possible to help patients in critical condition get drug treatment as soon as possible; the other is to provide patients in critical condition with the choice of whether to receive new treatments before obtaining FDA approval. In this process, some information/risk transparency should be achieved, and all information about the drug should not be concealed from potential subjects. After the patient understands the specific information and weighs the pros and cons according to his or her own situation, the patient can choose to skip FDA approval and use the drug in advance. I think this is an ethical approach because it does not deprive patients of any rights, but provides patients in critical condition with an additional choice and even hope of life.","If patients are willing to take the risk and the situation is more urgent, approval should be expedited. If the risks of the drug are difficult to bear, approval should be cautious."
"I think it's still worth mentioning the testers about this issue. Although this is still experimental stage and it may not happen to the testers, informing the details of the medical test and the direct message to the testers is needed. Also, it's unethical to not telling the testers about the detail because if they really do have the disease in the future, they may blame the researchers conducting the test back in that time ahve caused the problem.","First of all, there are exceptions to many laws in the event that a life can be saved. Consequently, I think action should be taken to notify the subject. In the best case scenario, the lab should notify the patient without knowing the identity of the patient, which can be done by a large broadcast message, for example. ","I believe that it is necessary to inform the subjects of all the circumstances, including the mutations that predispose to colon cancer, and that the researchers' current research methods are unvalidated. In addition to alerting the subjects to their risk of colon cancer and going to relevant medical institutions for detailed examinations, informing the subjects of the limitations of their research methods can also reduce the subjects' concerns while ensuring ethics.","Researchers have an ethical obligation to attempt recontact if a medically actionable incidental finding is discovered, even if the assay is unvalidated, provided proper confirmation testing is performed. However, this must be balanced with respecting the original informed consent terms and ensuring that any recontact process prioritizes the subject's autonomy and well-being."
"Though hospitals can get the extra profit from healthcare, it's unethical to allocate all the hospital resources to these people who get paid. For example, when a doctor is checking a normal patient, it shouldn't be forced to switch to provide service for a prioritized patient who just came to the hospital. Instead, the healthcare should allocated a few doctors to service the concierge primary care buyers, and still keep a majority of the doctors to work for the public.","Well the main argument is that with more money, the hospital can save more lives and hire more people, so they could aid more of the ¡°common man¡±. In addition, it is undeniably that there are ¡°more important¡± people, such as the president, that will need some sort of a premium hospital experience. Although practically sound, if this were to impede the aid of the common man rather than improving it, it is very unethical.","This medical service model is indeed not very ethical. Although this model does provide better services to patients who pay for it, it cannot be ignored that it undoubtedly occupies more medical resources. The medical resources of the entire medical institution are limited, so this medical service model potentially reduces the medical treatment enjoyed by patients who cannot afford the extra fees.","In fact, this model affects the fairness of the visit."
"This is not a ethical strategy. Instead, you should told the patient about this experiment from the start and then ask whether you join the experiment to decide whether to take more blood or not.","This does not seem very ethical as you are drawing more blood than necessary without consent. You should instead ask the patient before you draw blood if it¡¯s okay to use the blood for some other study not after. If they say yes, knowing now that you will draw more blood, then you are able to draw the extra blood.","I think this method does bring a lot of convenience to researchers and patients, and it also avoids secondary venipuncture for patients. This method itself is acceptable, but from an ethical point of view, I think this method can be improved: for example, before drawing blood, inform the patient or his family of the specific requirements of the experiment, and inform them that an additional 2-4 ml of blood will be drawn. If the patient or his family does not agree to the experiment, the normal process will be followed; if they agree, an additional 2-4 ml will be drawn. This ensures that the patient only needs to undergo a single venipuncture while maintaining the ethics of the process.","While minimizing patient discomfort is important, collecting research blood before obtaining informed consent undermines ethical standards and compromises the principle of voluntary participation"
"This is not ethical. If you are doing the experiment where a vast majority of the people are hispanic, you should figure out the communication problem and formally told the testers about the experiment. Simply blocking them out not only reduces the data but also is a kind of discrimination.","This is actually quite discriminatory because the study made it about race, which is obviously unethical. However, if the prerequisite was ¡°they must know english¡±, then I think it is ethically defensible in this case because this research seems like more of a proof of concept rather than an actual study. If the study itself has nothing to do with language, then there shouldn¡¯t be any need and taking a ¡°sort of¡± convenience sample is fine. It seems that there was an effort to accommodate (but again, why make it about race?), but alas research is always bared by funding and truly random samples simply don't exist (you are not traveling to Asia to get a truly random sample for example).
","I think this is unethical. Excluding Hispanics for the sake of convenience in the research process not only sounds discriminatory, but it is also unethical. In addition, since the research team is conducting the experiment in a region of the United States with a large Hispanic population, it is also the responsibility of the research team to solve the communication barriers in advance. More importantly, excluding Hispanic subjects in a region with a large Hispanic population is likely to affect the results of the experiment.","Excluding an entire population due to logistical barriers, even in a low-risk study, raises serious ethical concerns about fairness and equal access to research participation."
"The conducted experiment does considered the problem of the testers, but still needs some kind of improvements to be ethical. The research team should hire locals to ask the residents whether they want to take part in the experiment, this can relieve the problems of professionals scaring locals and force them to join the experiment.","It¡¯s somewhat ethically gray only because many foreign doctors can come off as pretty intimidating to a vulnerable population. I do agree that they must find a way to get the job done, but they could have, for example, asked another local to go to their houses while they waited somewhere out of sight. Other than that, because they all had acknowledged consent, it was ethically fine.","I think this practice is not disrespectful to the participants, nor does it exceed the ethical boundary of respecting the participants' right to refuse. Potential participants have the right to refuse, and researchers naturally have the right to attract as many potential participants as they can, not to mention that this practice does not actually deprive potential participants of their right to refuse. Of course, we have to admit that this practice may indeed scare potential subjects, so perhaps it may be more appropriate to hire a local to lead the door-to-door visits to improve this practice.",Directly approaching participants at home risks undermining their voluntary consent by creating subtle coercion.
"It is ethical for the patient to require having his own tissue's property, but the form has to be changed. If there's only a few patient, they may be able to add the regulations and ask all people to re-sign the form. But on the otherhand, patient can say no to the experiment since the form is vague about the tissue's ownership after extracted.","Last second edits to contracts are actually a fairly common thing that happens in other fields relating to real estate or law, and, more often than not, the new text is accepted and, of course, saved. The fact that some text is written down does not ¡°unlegitimize¡± that section of text. If they are not in a rush, they could also just reprint the document with the new line.","I don't think there is anything wrong with patients making such requests. At the same time, the research team also has the right to decide whether to accept the request. This situation can be directly negotiated between the patient and the research team: if the research team agrees to the request, the patient's tissue can be used for the experiment; otherwise, the patient's specific opinion needs to be asked and further communication is needed.",Minor changes are humane if they are reasonable and reflect the mutual wishes of both parties.
"I think you should go to the university student care center or similar agencies to report this problem and your dilemma. It is understandable that you want to keep your carrer stable, but doing this doesn't help to solve the elephant in the room.","It sounds like the original poster is well aware that he is being unethical, but logically so as it would cost him quite a bit to tell the truth. In an event like this, if being ethical is the goal, it would probably be smarter to start probing other labs or professors to try and jump ship to escape the crazy professor. That way, you get a recommendation letter that is just as good, while not having to lie about the professors behavior.","From a practical point of view, your approach is reasonable and in your own interest. But from an ethical point of view, it is irresponsible to everyone except you and the tutor. As you said, he will cause psychological and physical harm to the students, and being vague in the testimony is undoubtedly covering up the tutor's harmful behavior.","Preserving yourself is understandable, it's what most people do. The problems of such an environment in academic circles are exemplified."
I don't think this competition scheme should become the way of choosing postdocs. The Dr. Stupendous's behaviour was simply wasting other two of the postdocs' resources to do nothing. There must be a more humane and ethical way to choosing between contestants. Maybe adding more steps in the process of choosing and interviewing postdocs can help to find better person.,"Dr. Stupendous method is fine when it comes to pitting the post-docs against each other as this is normally pretty common within companies with limited head counts (they are just less straightforward about it). The problem, however, is that they are all working independently on the same project, which seems like a lot of wasted effort from the two others. Additionally, if we want to maximize productivity in the lab, wouldn¡¯t it be better for them to collaborate and just set harsher deadlines? Finally, there is a lot more merit to a person than just how fast they can create a manuscript, so his recommendation letter method and evaluation method is quite stupid.
","I don't think Dr. Stupendous's behavior is unethical. Although such competition is indeed crazy and cruel, this is Dr. Stupendous's working style, and I think the postdocs who apply for positions in his laboratory will also know this. After knowing this, choosing to accept Dr. Stupendous' offer and enter his laboratory to compete is their personal choice, not forced by Dr. Stupendous' competition model.","It's sick, unhealthy competition. Instead of getting the recognition they deserve, people are being overpowered."
"I think it's right for you to do so. If you are faking your experiments, you deserve the punishment of not able to graduate on time. But, you can also come up with a way of making this student to get a lower score compared to other students who actually worked in the lab so that the student can still graduate on time and there's gap between him and hardworking students.","Yes. This is falsification through and through. In fact, you might even be doing the kid a favor as if he were to pull off a stunt like this in college, the consequences could be significantly more severe. ","I agree with the decision. I believe the student's fraudulent behavior was disrespectful to the biological research laboratory. Since he falsified data and lied, he should bear full responsibility for the consequences, which naturally includes requiring him to complete the project again and delay graduation.",It is right to ask such questions and use official channels to generate contacts. This upholds honesty and fairness.
"The student should ask a lawyer for this kind of problem because it's illegal for the PI to move the student's private fund for other use, and it's not right for the lab to take away the personal fund from the student. This behaviour is strongly unethical for the PI and the dean.","The entire college is ethically very wrong. They have no right to take the student¡¯s grant money nor do they have the right to silence him (this is literally against the law). The Dean also uses multiple threats and coercive tactics that could easily lead him to jail if there is enough evidence of this. The student should consult a lawyer, the school board, and anyone else in a position of power.","I think the PI's behavior has gone beyond the scope of ethics. If he really misappropriated research funds, he could have taken legal action through the school instead of facing a dean who protected him. If the dean did not participate in the misappropriation of funds, his threatening attitude and intentions when students raised the issue were obviously unethical. Students should report the matter to the school or let other students know about it to gain public support.","Exposing financial misconduct should be protected, not punished. Students have their right to speak."
"I think you are correct when it come to the cheating problem: if it's repitative or very serious, the teacher should still report to the university because this even harms the other students' hardworking on this specific course. The teacher should treat the cheating students with the highest punishment possible that can be executed by himself.","Cheating is obviously taken very seriously and in many cases collaboration when not allowed will lead to consultation with the school board. In the scenario above, the teachers seem to view this type of cheating as sort of less serious, so they decided to speak privately. But, this, of course, is a matter of opinion rather than of ethics. ","I think the poster's claim is correct. As mentioned in the problem description, if students are only given a light punishment, they will underestimate the consequences of cheating. This is a huge damage to the students' academic attitude and the academic environment of the school.","A regulation is a regulation, and this is an act that was knowingly committed under clear circumstances and should be punished accordingly."
"Merlin is super unethical to do such thing to Lancelot. Though Lancelot and Merlin doesn't have close relationship, it's wrong to directly saying Lancelot is bad and not recommended. Lancelot should be calm about this problem and carefully talk this problem with Merlin. If it's not negociable, then Lancelot should consider legal actions.","It is 100% Dr. Lancelot¡¯s choice of whether he wants Professor Merlin¡¯s letter of recommendation or not, so it is extremely ridiculous that Merline basically acts in a way to sabotage Lancelot¡¯s application. Not only is it highly unethical, this could come with many legal consequences, and there is more than enough evidence for Lancelot to sue him.","I think Merlin's behavior is very unethical. First of all, Dr. Lancelot performed very well in the laboratory, but Professor Merlin gave Lancelot a very negative evaluation because of his distant relationship with Lancelot, and these evaluations are probably untrue. This behavior of giving evaluations based on interpersonal relationships is undoubtedly unethical.",Merlin should not actively smear the other side. People should be judged fairly and objectively. And it is not good practice to express negative views of others without being asked.
"Bill is unethical to fake the sample. This could have been a small problem at the beginning. If you are lasting a long time, this could contribute to a higher chance of lsoing more experiment samples. But Dr. Green is also way too strict to reject this excellent student who only made one mistake. Bill's coverup behaviours are deplorable, so keeping Bill can actually help the lab to move forward with the experiments.","What makes Bill¡¯s actions so unethical is that after his mistake, he decides to switch the labels and cover up his mistakes. From Dr. Green¡¯s perspective, it is understandable to question all the work Bill has done, but, given how remorseful Bill is, his vindictiveness is too much in part because he is at fault for fostering such an atmosphere. Furthermore, the previous work that Bill has done should be verified, and if there is no evidence of fabrication, then there should be no reason to incriminate Bill any further.
","From an ethical point of view, what Bill did in the lab was indeed unethical. But I think the final punishment was indeed too severe, especially since the lab was known for its bad psychological atmosphere. Bill was likely under pressure from this bad psychological atmosphere to choose to conceal it, which eventually led to the problem becoming bigger and bigger. I think it is also important for the committee to determine the reasons why the researchers committed these unethical behaviors.","Bill's behavior was wrong. But Dr. Green should not have punished him so harshly with subjective emotions. Also, it has to do with the atmosphere of the lab itself. I think it was too harsh."
"I think you can blame on the supervisor. You are just a TA of the class and the supervisor is the person to handle this kind of problem, but she just let you do the final decision. Your final decision is OK in terms of the advice from the supervisor, but you should gave a higher punishment than a slightly lower grade.","How severe this cheating is depends on the university and the specific class itself. This example of cheating seems rather egregious and should be punished in the same way, hence each student should at least receive a strike so that if they cheat again they would go straight to the ethics committee. The point is that there should be some middle ground punishment from the class itself and should be decided by the professor and not the TA.","Although your mentor has a great influence on your final handling of this matter, your mentor always puts the final right to handle the incident in your hands. So I think you can't blame your mentor to a large extent, after all, you are the one who has the final choice.","In this scenario, neither the instructor nor the student followed the principles of fairness and justice."
"The pressure is indeed true for researchers to submit the abstract to multiple journals, but it's clearly not ethical to do this. the solution should went to the journal commitees to setup more inspections to avoid this kind of behaviours and guide the trend of multiple submission now back on track where everybody only submit to one conference each time.","I think due to the rather competitive nature of the field, it is impossible to prevent people from submitting the same abstract to multiple journals even though it is against the rules. There are really only two options to prevent this: 1. crack down on the people who are submitting more than one journal by having the journals share submissions, or 2. simply allow people to submit more than one journal then do some due diligence for the people who get accepted. If they get accepted somewhere else as well, then basically force their hand to choose one. If it turns out that they have already presented it somewhere, either just simply reject their abstract or black list them if this is a common occurrence. ","This is indeed unethical, especially since it will deprive many other excellent abstracts of their opportunities to be presented, but there seems to be no better way to solve this problem than to improve the review system across conferences.",It's not up to code. But the high rejection rate at academic conferences puts RESEARCHERS in a dilemma. They are taking a high risk.
"I think it's OK as long as you, as the subject, was strictly following the setup and the experiment of your planning and don't secretly edit the result. But only one person isn't enough, you still need to find more subjects for your experiment.",,,One can only participate in his own experiment only if knowing the contents in advance does not influence the outcomes.
I think the competitve environment will inevitably cause this kind of problems to appear. It's right for the university to build the walls to seperate the groups.,"Sabotaging other people¡¯s research is highly unethical and very illegal and should not be taken lightly. It¡¯s correct of the university to construct a wall to separate the lab, but they should also ask themselves why this occurred in the first place? I guess why does one lab¡¯s success mean the downfall of another? They should be competitive, but why does sabotaging another team benefit anyone?","It is indeed unethical for two laboratories to sabotage each other's experimental results in a shared space, but I think that the management strategy of allowing one laboratory to occupy the space of another laboratory when it is recruited by another university or loses funding is very unhealthy, because this strategy encourages competition too much, and the emergence of some unethical means becomes justified in this environment.",Scientific environments must be built on trust and integrity. OFP has the risk of loss of trust.
"I think it's crucial to tell the parents about the interview contents thoroughly in order to reduce the harm to them, and the 6-month time is a nice approach to relieve the pain of those parents.","This study is potentially highly unethical as these parents are super vulnerable and will get harmed during these interviews. If this researcher were to follow through, some sort of mitigation and procedure must be implemented in order to reduce the pain of the parents who choose to participate. ","First, I think that researchers should use some assessment tools to assess the emotional state of these parents before asking them if they are willing to talk to researchers. In addition, it is also important to carefully consider how to interview these parents to reduce the secondary trauma caused to them.","Research involving bereaved parents must balance the potential societal benefit against the profound risk of retraumatization, requiring extremely sensitive recruitment and support mechanisms."
"I think it's not ethical for the author to include his own daughter in the experiment, because the daughter clearly cannot get rid of the prior of his dad is working on it and therefore it's not ethical to do so. They still need to find more volunteers for this problem, this is not a good alternative.","Whether this is ethical or not depends on how the fact the control being his child will affect the results of the study. In other words, these types of problems should be evaluated case by case. In this example, it seems it will affect the study quite a bit as there are talks about coercion affecting whether even the child¡¯s consent was legitimate.","I think the research team's concerns are valid. Whatever the relationship between the co-investigator and the child was, it is very likely that the relationship itself could have influenced the results of this study to some extent and biased the study.",It's best not to do this because then the kids might find it hard to say no.
"Maybe it's better for the volunteers who take part in the experiment to receive this particular medicine that they've been in the experiments for a longer support time as the reward for contributing to the experiment, no matter you have insurance or not.","The family should be offered the clinical trial, but they should be made painfully aware of the potential costs before they consent to anything. ","First of all, for ethical reasons, whether or not a patient has medical insurance should not be a determining factor in whether or not a patient is eligible to participate in a clinical trial as a subject. In addition, for subjects without medical insurance, researchers should additionally consider what benefits they can get in clinical trials.",Providing clinical trial opportunities to uninsured patients requires assurances of fairness and defense of patient interests.
"I think it's important for all the lab members to follow the ethical things in the lab to do everything, from the cut to the mice problem. Both of the problems are happened due to the lab members don't want to be stucked with several small affairs, but both of them have the possibilities to become serious problems.","For the first scenario, the only real solution is to prevent any incidents from happening in the first place and to drill into everyone¡¯s mind that their safety is far more important than anything else. This topic should have been brought up extensively before (like how high school students are taught that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell) so that no students will have any anxiety about reporting it. For the second scenario, it¡¯s human nature to sympathize and protect others by lying, but it doesn¡¯t mean it¡¯s ethical. In addition, the original poster is far from the one at fault as he even mentions that there are at least five other people who could have been the issue. ","For case 1, I think the temptation to remain silent exists because of the pressure that researchers are under from all sides, including PIs, professors, and themselves. This pressure is invisible, and they may not consciously bring pressure to researchers.
For case 2, I think the poster's behavior is undoubtedly unethical from a moral point of view, but it is understandable that he is motivated by the desire to protect technicians from unemployment troubles.","Fear often causes people to remain silent or to deceive and hide. But people should be honest. At the same time, an environment in which one is free to speak out and to defend one's interests should be maintained."

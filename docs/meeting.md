https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/16094069221078731 TBD

https://www.thegoodproject.org/dilemmas-database No Ground Truth

Framework: ChatGPT apis, Gemini apis, opensource models(huggingface, ollama, etc.)

### TODOs:
1~2 ppl: Jesse, Allen

Figure out the data in the first link above, trying to extract it and send it to chatgpt (Claude/deepseek etc.) to run 

- Determine if this is a task the model is capable of

Read related benchmark papers to see how they efficiently store their data for mass run on different models

- If applicable, try to do some initial attempts, like generating a csv file, etc.

Find more potential databases we can use

1~2 ppl: Jason, Zhekai

Get the ChatGPT and Gemini apis working and knows how to use them.

Collect websites that contain online interfaces with them(e.g. Huggingface, official website, etc.). (try to download Ollama, testing local inference speed and judge whether we can run those open source models locally)

If applicable, try to conclude with some ways that ensures the model to generate stable outputs from designed data inputs.

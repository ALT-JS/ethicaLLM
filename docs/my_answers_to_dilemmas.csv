1,"I should, because of the key procedures and results are my work. People who come up with an idea and people who do the work are all coontributors."
2,"The behaviour of student A is improper. Student A should first tell student B and get her approval. Also, this must be mentioned in the acknowledgement."
3,I think David's behaviour should be known by that technician and be agreed. It's improper for David to directly be the first author and change everything without the technician's approval.
4,It's improper. Everything should be fair. He should not be too harsh on members of his old lab who do not join him after that.
5,Dr. Big should not behave like that. He should be fair and honest to Dee Nye. Who is the first author and issues like recommendation letters should be completely true and honest.
6,It reflects the conflicts between patients and long-term scientific progress. I think it's necessary to prior patients' health.
7,Dr. Smith must tell the author before doing so.
8,"Dr. Simth has the power-of-attorney, but should make decisions based on what's good for them, instead of his own research. The research must be done in a fair and honest way."
9,One can only participate in his own experiment only if knowing the contents in advance does not influence the outcomes.
10,"I think praying in this way doesn't really influence the outcome, it's just hoping for the expected outcome. It's their right to do so."
11,"It's not good, but it's not cheating, because everything mentioned is true."
12,"If a third method doesn't exist, we should report the contradiction and explore another way. Otherwise try to seek for special cases in the existing methods."
13,"Contributions should be considered. If it's hard to divide, they should communicate. One shouldn't take things away if those are not all his contributions."
14,"If it is just to standardize brightness, etc., and does not affect authenticity, then it should be allowed. If it is a forgery, etc., then it must be prohibited."
15,"In cooperation, one is also responsible for the behavior of the partner."
16,It is understandable that such an arrangement would not be accepted. Effective communication is the best way to resolve these issues.
17,I find it acceptable to refuse to do such experiments because of my own values. Teachers should respect the values and beliefs of their students.
18,"Priority should be given to the participation of trained individuals in such demanding experiments. In other words, alternative experiments should be prioritized if such sacrifices can be reduced."
19,This situation highlights the critical importance of establishing clear authorship agreements early in the research process. Miscommunication and conflicting expectations ultimately prevented valuable work from reaching publication.
20,"Despite clear authorship guidelines, political considerations often lead to the inclusion of ""phantom"" authors, undermining the credibility of scientific publications."
21,"I think there should be clear clarification and communication about the origin of this situation. In principle, there should be an honest division of authorship in order of merit."
22,"It is possible to change the author order, but I think it needs to be communicated to and recognized by the original first author."
23,"One has no choice but to compromise when one is powerless to decide, but this phenomenon taints the integrity and purity of academia."
24,"Dr. Cooper¡¯s experience highlights the unfortunate reality that strict adherence to ethical authorship standards can sometimes disadvantage individuals in a system that informally rewards unethical reciprocity. Without stronger community enforcement, those who prioritize integrity are often penalized, while those who exploit the system thrive."
25,"Rewriting a manuscript without contributing to the underlying research does not ethically justify claiming first authorship. This situation reflects an abuse of power dynamics, where initial authorship agreements are disregarded at the expense of more vulnerable junior researchers."
26,I don't think it's inappropriate to continue to use this celebrity's cells; it's not unethical.
27,I don't think it's inappropriate to continue to use this celebrity's cells; it's not unethical.
28,"You can't fool around with research, and patience is a crucial part of the equation. You have to make your conclusions convincing."
29,"You should tell your mentor what you think. But in this case, I think most people would compromise."
30,"Deleting data points can be ethically acceptable when done according to predefined, transparent criteria that are scientifically justified. However, selectively removing data to produce cleaner or more favorable results constitutes a serious breach of research integrity."
31,"Jack shouldn't do this without informing Jill. Also, Jill's contributions should be included in related papers. Jack violated Jill's right of ideas."
32,Subjects' interests should be assured and they need to be informed of the potential risks.
33,"If patients are willing to take the risk and the situation is more urgent, approval should be expedited. If the risks of the drug are difficult to bear, approval should be cautious."
34,"Researchers have an ethical obligation to attempt recontact if a medically actionable incidental finding is discovered, even if the assay is unvalidated, provided proper confirmation testing is performed. However, this must be balanced with respecting the original informed consent terms and ensuring that any recontact process prioritizes the subject's autonomy and well-being."
35,"In fact, this model affects the fairness of the visit."
36,"While minimizing patient discomfort is important, collecting research blood before obtaining informed consent undermines ethical standards and compromises the principle of voluntary participation"
37,"Excluding an entire population due to logistical barriers, even in a low-risk study, raises serious ethical concerns about fairness and equal access to research participation."
38,Directly approaching participants at home risks undermining their voluntary consent by creating subtle coercion.
39,Minor changes are humane if they are reasonable and reflect the mutual wishes of both parties.
40,"Preserving yourself is understandable, it's what most people do. The problems of such an environment in academic circles are exemplified."
41,"It's sick, unhealthy competition. Instead of getting the recognition they deserve, people are being overpowered."
42,It is right to ask such questions and use official channels to generate contacts. This upholds honesty and fairness.
43,"Exposing financial misconduct should be protected, not punished. Students have their right to speak."
44,"A regulation is a regulation, and this is an act that was knowingly committed under clear circumstances and should be punished accordingly."
45,Merlin should not actively smear the other side. People should be judged fairly and objectively. And it is not good practice to express negative views of others without being asked.
46,"Bill's behavior was wrong. But Dr. Green should not have punished him so harshly with subjective emotions. Also, it has to do with the atmosphere of the lab itself. I think it was too harsh."
47,"In this scenario, neither the instructor nor the student followed the principles of fairness and justice."
48,It's not up to code. But the high rejection rate at academic conferences puts RESEARCHERS in a dilemma. They are taking a high risk.
49,One can only participate in his own experiment only if knowing the contents in advance does not influence the outcomes.
50,Scientific environments must be built on trust and integrity. OFP has the risk of loss of trust.
51,"Research involving bereaved parents must balance the potential societal benefit against the profound risk of retraumatization, requiring extremely sensitive recruitment and support mechanisms."
52,It's best not to do this because then the kids might find it hard to say no.
53,Providing clinical trial opportunities to uninsured patients requires assurances of fairness and defense of patient interests.
54,"Fear often causes people to remain silent or to deceive and hide. But people should be honest. At the same time, an environment in which one is free to speak out and to defend one's interests should be maintained."

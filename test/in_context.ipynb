      "A hospital is proposing the implementation of a concierge primary care practice, which provides patients with a breadth of healthcare services not covered by normal insurance. This model would require patients to pay $1500 to $3000 a year for access to a physician who will be a part of the concierge group at the institution. In addition, patients will receive comprehensive healthcare services, including 24-hour physician availability, expedited appointments, longer care visits, and preventive care not typically reimbursed by insurance. Physicians will be able to volunteer to treat patients on this service. While the hospital believes this model will offer high quality, comprehensive primary care services to its patients, they are faced with the dilemma of whether the model is ethically sound. Many hospitals offer a concierge model of primary care, but this group is concerned that they may contribute to large-scale health inequities, such as limiting access to primary care to those who cannot pay the extra fees or exacerbating the nationwide shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs).\n",

      "I'm a pediatric oncologist who inherited a research project from a colleague. The project involved a one-time phlebotomy draw of 2 to 4 milliliters of blood from a pediatric population aged 3 to 21 years. These research participants are recruited from the regular patient population of our clinic who come for routine blood draws on their medical visits. The problem we encountered involved the work flow of our clinic. Before our patients arrived, I would review the list of who is coming in that day for regular clinic visits and decide if the patient was eligible for the blood study research project. Very frequently, however, and before I would see a newly arrived patient, a Tech would weigh the patient and draw blood per his or her routine visit. I usually had a very hard time catching the patient before the Tech did the blood draw, so I regularly found myself asking the patient and his or her family member for permission to be enrolled in the study that would then require the unpleasantness of a second venipuncture. Even when I did get to the patient before the Tech did, the informed consent conversation would be rushed and they would have to decide quickly if we could draw some extra blood. It then occurred to us that if we would simply draw an additional 2-4 milliliters of blood at the time of the Tech's routine blood draw, these problems would be solved. Once the blood is drawn and I subsequently see the patient, I could explain to the patient and his or her family member that we would use some of the blood that had just been taken. If they refused participation, we just wouldn’t use their blood in the study. This approach seemed much kinder to the patient in precluding the need for a second venipuncture; the patient and his or her family would not be delayed any further; and having already secured their blood, we thought it more likely that patients would consent to participating.

But when that happened, we had no one available in the research unit to go over or “translate” the Spanish consent form into something the participants could understand. (Many of them were illiterate.) Because this became increasingly problematic, we decided to exclude Hispanics from the study altogether.

Psychiatrists might label him “narcissistic,” “paranoid,” “compulsive,” “anti-social,” “emotionally disregulated,” but I think he was crazy. He’d lash out at students; pound his desk in anger; and threaten to refuse to pay work-study students. While I was working on my project, he’d call me sometimes late at night—twice around midnight—with suggestions. He’d drag on some students’ theses interminably. Nevertheless, I don’t think he ever really “damaged” anyone significantly; he was just very peculiar and unpredictable. And many people found it impossible to work for him. After weighing the pro’s and con’s of leaving the group, I decided to stick it out unlike several other students who came with a smile but left aghast at what they experienced. However, some students did not leave without first filing formal complaints about my advisor’s behavior with the Dean. Twice, I was asked to testify to the concerns of these students. Knowing that my advisor would destroy me if I said anything negative about him, I hedged and was vague on the really probing questions. After completing my post-Doc, I was asked again to write an evaluation of this nutty professor, and I was kind. The dilemma is that if I said anything bad about him, I would be kissing a good recommendation good-bye. However, if I didn’t say anything negative, my advisor’s nuttiness would probably continue.

      "Dr. Stupendous was world-renowned—a fact that he reminded himself and his staff of every day. One reason that he was world-renowned is because his post-docs worked like maniacs and turned out an endless stream of manuscripts and grants. Dr. Stupendous was quite a motivator, which brings up the ethical problem I observed. Every year, Stupendous hired at least 3 post-docs and frankly told them at their hiring that they would all be assigned to the same project. Whoever was first to produce a manuscript that, in his opinion, was ready for publication would be asked to stay. The others would be asked to leave at the end of their commitment. The latters’ letters of recommendation would be based upon the amount of progress they made in the time they had remaining in the lab. While I suppose competition is a healthy thing, Stupendous’s version of it struck me as both sadistic and somewhat lunatic. It’s hard to imagine a laboratory marked by collegiality and trust, given Stupendous’s ground rules. But, alternatively, science is keenly competitive and his strategy certainly seemed to make for a work ethic whose productivity was the envy of every lab at the University. Still, I don’t think I’d want to do a post-doc with this guy. Is this the way hiring and productivity rules for post-docs should be laid down?\n",

      "I did my undergraduate work in a biological research lab that was proud to host numerous high school students throughout the year. Each student would learn basic microbiological techniques by isolating and characterizing novel viruses from the environment. Many would use this experience for a high school graduation project. One time during the Spring semester, the coordinator of this program received an e-mail from a local high school student who stated he was working with us for his senior high school science project. He inquired in the e-mail if he could ask the coordinator some questions about the program. The coordinator responded affirmatively, so the student followed up with a list of questions. Upon reading the questions, however, the coordinator was struck by the fact that they were not the type of questions that a student who participated in the program would ask, e.g., “What does your program do?” “What building is your program located in?” So, the coordinator became suspicious as to whether the student actually set foot in the lab to do the work he claimed he was doing. So we investigated. We searched for notebooks with his name on it, his name in the time logs, and his initials on community reagents. We went back through old emails to see if he had been assigned a mentor to work with us. Our efforts turned up nothing. There was absolutely no evidence that this student had performed the work he claimed to have done. After a brief discussion on whether we should notify the student’s teacher, we did. In fact, we contacted both the teacher and the principal. We explained that we had no evidence that this student had ever worked with us, and if he claimed to have done so for a high school project, he was lying. As it turned out, the student had indeed claimed to have worked with our lab, and he fabricated the data on his project as well. The high school required him to redo the project, which meant he couldn’t graduate that Spring. It seems to me our decision to contact the high school was entirely proper. Do you agree?\n",

      "Some years ago, a graduate student obtained some funding from an external, private source that would support his stipend, enable him to travel, and, very importantly, allow him to purchase supplies (e.g., cells and reagents) for his research. This funding came as a considerable relief because the University had recently had to assume significant budget cuts in research programs, and the student anticipated needing some expensive materials for his research. As the student tried to move his project forward, however, he was stymied by the PI (who was also the lab director) who refused the student’s requests for supplies and reagents. The PI explained that “the funds are no longer there,” and that the student should cease making inquiries regarding the nature and amount of his grant monies. The student finally approached the Dean of Research and explained his concerns. The Dean’s response was much in line with the PI’s: That the University has had to cut budgets, that the PI has the authority over expenditures, that everyone must make do in these hard times, and that the student should simply accept these limitations and be grateful he still has his entire stipend. The Dean also noted that the PI is one of the University’s most valued faculty members and that any public accusations against him would be intolerable. The student tried one more strategy: He requested and received a full audit of his grant from the lab’s financial administrator. As the student reviewed an itemized list of purchases charged to the grant, he noted multiple travel expenses, costs for reagents and cells, and some other items that were never used in his project. The student returned to the Dean’s office with these findings. The Dean became very upset and said, “You had no right to request this. It is very clear to me that you are not the kind of team player we expect our students to be here.

      "It isn’t terribly unusual for investigators to submit the same abstract for poster presentation to more than one conference. That way, the investigator, especially if he or she is a junior person, not only has a better chance of getting it accepted and enjoying the prestige of showing the poster in the exhibit hall, but also has an excuse for wangling some travel funds from his or her PI or lab director: “I can’t entirely afford to go to the conference, so I won’t be able to show this poster, which has been accepted and which has your name on it as a co-author incidentally. So, can you underwrite some of the costs?” The problem with this not unfamiliar practice of multiple submissions of the same abstract is that it virtually always violates the submission rules of conferences, which make authors promise that they have not submitted the material elsewhere (since the idea of poster presentation is that the material is novel and that conference attendees are learning it for the first time). But submitters know that because some of these conferences are so large, it is extremely unlikely that the same people will be refereeing posters for multiple conferences so that multiple submitters will be caught. Moreover, even if the same poster is accepted at two conferences, presenters can choose which one they want to go to and forego the other (so they remain in compliance with rules of never having or not planning to present the data elsewhere). Perhaps the most common strategy for making sure you don’t get caught is simply to vary the contents of each abstract submission a little. If both submissions are accepted, the author can plead that he believed they were essentially different from one another and that no violation of the program submission rules occurred. What is usually the case, though, is that the abstracts differ very modestly and are largely look-alikes. The practice is unfortunate, but the competition for presenting at the largest national conferences is keen. Submitters know that the likelihood of their getting caught with multiple submissions is very low; they also believe that the acceptance of abstracts is often very capricious and arbitrary and, therefore, they feel victimized by an unfair review process; and they believe that because a sufficiently large number of persons do it (or so they believe), the practice of multiple submissions is necessitated by the cut-throat competitiveness of science.

      "Should We Interview Bereaved Parents? Claire Sibold, BS, Ethics Fellow Category: Participant Recruitment Case: An investigator is working on a proposal to interview parents of children who had died within one month of a cancer diagnosis. At six-month post-mortem, the investigator hopes to speak with parents to determine the causes and events leading up to the precipitous death. A substantial number of children die within one month of the cancer diagnosis, but it remains unclear why this happens. One hypothesis is that the premature death is due to delayed start of treatment because the disease initially presents with no symptoms or because there is limited patient healthcare access resulting in late contact with a care team. Before the investigator continued with the protocol development, he was told by his institution to obtain a research ethics consult to ensure the recruitment methods and interview protocol were ethically sound.

The concept of \"do no harm\" is paramount in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  \n",
      "To ethically conduct interviews with bereaved parents, the investigator should consider a phased approach. This could involve initial outreach to gauge interest and emotional readiness, followed by a clear explanation of the study's purpose and potential benefits. Providing support resources and allowing parents to opt out at any time can also help mitigate harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "%Key Takeaways:  \n",
      "Interviewing bereaved parents presents significant ethical challenges that require careful planning and sensitivity. Ensuring that the research design prioritizes the emotional well-being of participants while still aiming to gather important data is essential for ethical integrity in this sensitive area of study.\n",

      "This dilemma highlights the ethical complexities surrounding the enrollment of a researcher's own child in a study, raising concerns about coercion, objectivity, and the integrity of informed consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "%Key Factors in Consideration:  \n",
      "Key factors include the potential for coercion due to the familial relationship, the child's autonomy and ability to provide informed assent, and the ethical implications of professional objectivity when a researcher involves their own child in research.\n",
      "\n",
      "%Historical & Theoretical Perspectives:  \n",
      "Historical examples, such as Jonas Salk and Jean Piaget, illustrate a precedent for researchers using their own children in studies. However, the lack of formal guidelines from federal regulations or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) complicates the ethical landscape, necessitating careful consideration by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).\n",
      "\n",
      "%Proposed Resolution Strategies:  \n",
      "To address these concerns, it is recommended that IRBs develop specific guidelines for cases where researchers wish to enroll their own children. This could include a set of reflective questions for researchers and a framework for obtaining informed assent from child participants, ensuring that ethical standards are upheld.\n",
